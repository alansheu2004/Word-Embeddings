The Super Scope, known as the Nintendo Scope in European languages, is a light gun peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It fires an infrared beam that is picked up by a sensor placed on top of the television, and where on the screen it is aiming is determined by the sensor after calibrating the scope by shooting a test target screen. Various games utilized this hardware; the only Super Mario game to utilize it was Yoshi's Safari, where it was also seen and used by Mario in-game. 
The Super Scope is frequently depicted as a type of gun in-game. Aside from its heavy use in Yoshi's Safari, Super Scopes also make a cameo as used by Sniper Bills in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake. The peripheral can be seen in the WarioWare: Touched! microgame Gunslinger. In Volume 8 of Super Mario-kun, Mario uses a Super Scope (sent by Princess Peach) to defeat the Kurokyura.
The Super Scope is featured as an item in the Super Smash Bros. series starting with Super Smash Bros. Melee, allowing players to fire energy balls at their opponents, either in dozens of small bullets or several large charged-up shots (three in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Super Smash Bros. Brawl and five in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate). When a player repeatedly shoots small blasts in a line, the opponent is unable to move away when hit, but the player also cannot move while firing; starting with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, though, the player can walk and jump while firing the item.
The Devolution Gun used to cause de-evolution in the Super Mario Bros. film is a modified Super Scope.
