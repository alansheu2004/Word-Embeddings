A vase, also called a Magic Vase or warp vase, is a special jar that appears in Yoshi's Story. Vases resemble the pots originally from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island; however, vases serve a different function. In Yoshi's Story, vases act similarly to the pipes from other installments of the Super Mario franchise. By jumping on top of a vase and pushing down, a Baby Yoshi enters the vase and is transported to a different location in the level. Unlike some (but not all) pipes, vases are only one-way, as they are not connected to other vases but instead generate small portals that warp the Yoshi to the next area. While jumping into a vase, the Baby Yoshi actually shrinks in size, then reappears normal-sized out of the portal (which quickly dissipates) upon reaching their destination. In some areas the Yoshi enters a vase, another vase in the next area sends them out. In that case, the Yoshi can return to the previous area by entering the vase they exited.
