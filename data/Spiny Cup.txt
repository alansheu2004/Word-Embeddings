The Spiny Cup is a cup that appears in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the Booster Course Pass DLC. It is the second of two cups in the sixth and final wave of the DLC, being released alongside the Acorn Cup, the twelfth and final cup of the pass overall, and the twenty-fourth and final cup of the game overall. The emblem of the cup is a Spiny Shell, making the Spiny Cup one of the two cups in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to have a kind of shell as its emblem, alongside the Shell Cup. Like most cups in the pass, it only features classic courses, ending with a Bowser's Castle and Rainbow Road course similarly to every Special Cup since Mario Kart: Super Circuit, making it the only classic course cup to do so. It is the first cup since the Moon Cup to not end on a course without a prefix or a Mario Kart Tour course, and the first cup since the Rock Cup to only feature one prefix-less or Mario Kart Tour course. It is also the only cup in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to have a course originally from Super Mario Kart that is not the second course in the cup. The decorations on this cup's trophy are purple.
