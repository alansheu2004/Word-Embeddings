The X-Naut ship is a ship captained by Lord Crump in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. It is a black ship with a spiky tail equipped with cannons. Besides the main cannon, the ship carries port and starboard cannons.
Lord Crump, disguised as Four-Eyes, reveals his true identity while standing atop the ship's main cannon. As he begins to attack Keelhaul Key with the ship's cannons, Mario and Flavio must seek Cortez to save everyone. With Cortez's ship, the Black Skull, they chase the X-Naut ship. This creates a melee between the shipwrecked Toads, Embers, and X-Nauts, along with Francesca and Frankie, leaving Mario and his team to deal with Lord Crump himself. The battle against Lord Crump and his X-Nauts takes place on the X-Naut ship, with the stage background matching it. After Lord Crump's defeat, the X-Naut ship sails away.
