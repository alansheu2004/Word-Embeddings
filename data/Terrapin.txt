Terrapins are armored, green-shelled Koopa Troopas that appear in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. In the game, they are the weakest soldiers in Bowser's Minions, even weaker than a Goomba. In Marrymore, a type called Torte acts as a chef, and a similar, stronger enemy is the red-shelled Terra Cotta. The word "terrapin" is an ambiguous term referring to turtles, which Koopas are quite similar to.
Terrapins fight solo or in groups of two to four and attack their opponents by punching, which does not do much damage. They patrol the halls of Bowser's Keep in search of intruders, and appear mostly in the very beginning of the game, before Exor crashes into Bowser's Keep. They have 10 HP and 1 attack power, and 8 defense. In the original game, Mario gains no Exp. pts. for defeating them, though they do give 1 EXP in the remake.
Later in the game at Rose Way, a platoon of Terrapins led by one named Jagger is seen with Bowser. After this group deserts, Jagger is later found in Monstro Town, training under Jinx to become strong enough to help Bowser again.
While unclear in the SNES version, the remake depicts the hammer-holding statues decorating the halls of Bowser's Keep as Terrapins, despite them not wielding hammers in battle.
