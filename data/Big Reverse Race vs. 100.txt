Big Reverse Race vs. 100 is a type of bonus challenge in Mario Kart Tour. It was added to the game's 2.14.0 update and was first released at the start of the 2023 Winter Tour. It is a version of the regular Big Reverse Race challenge, where the goal is similar to end the race in first place, but takes a slightly different approach. Players will start in 100th place and the objective is to aim for 1st place within a time limit using a set driver, kart, and glider, unlike the regular Big Reverse Race where players get to choose their setups. When the player gains ten spots ahead, the thirty second timer resets and the player is able to continue further. The amount of Grand Stars earned upon completing a Big Reverse Race vs. 100 bonus challenge is also determined by the places they either pass or end up in: one star for 80th place or higher, two for 40th place or higher, and three for 1st place. Despite the fact that the bonus challenge seemingly has ninety-nine opponents, there are actually only seven of them due to the game not supporting more than eight racers at once; each opponent is teleported ahead of the player once they are off-screen.
