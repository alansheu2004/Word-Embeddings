Fawfloppers are grasshopper-like creatures that resemble Fawful who appear in Blubble Lake in the game Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. They have green and yellow bodies, Fawful's grin and glasses, and large spring-loaded hind legs. Bowser can defeat these in the overworld.  All Bowser has to do is walk over one to defeat the creature and earn some coins.  This means Mario and Luigi exclusively can fight these creatures. A Fawflopper has two attacks, both of which are jumping attacks. Its main attack is lunging at a brother. It will first look at the brother before striking. This attack is countered with a jump. However, the Fawflopper may laugh before it does its attack, meaning it is going to jump over the bro, causing no damage if the bro does not jump. Its other attack includes defying gravity and hopping above the bro little by little. It will then try to fall on top of the bro. This attack can be countered with the hammer. It will look at the brother before striking.
