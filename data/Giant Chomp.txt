Giant Chomps are enemies in Donkey Kong Country Returns and its port. These red carnivorous plants are a variety of Chomp encountered in King of Cling only, but also appear in Crushin' Columns in the port. Giant Chomps are much larger than other Chomps. They have leaves instead of a vine, and possess spikes on their body. These enemies attack by leaping up towards the Kongs, attempting to injure them. Giant Chomps cannot be defeated by jumping on them and can only be defeated by throwing barrels at them. Additionally, the giant Chomps attack faster than the other species of Chomps.
As with its smaller variants, a single giant Chomp appears in Mario Golf: World Tour. It adopts the same behavioral aspect and vertical position seen in Donkey Kong Country Returns, and it now hinders the ball hit and thrown by the player. The giant Chomp is located around Hole 6 of DK Jungle.
