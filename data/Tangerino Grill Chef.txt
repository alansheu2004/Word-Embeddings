The Tangerino Grill Chef is a yellow Toad that appears in Paper Mario: Color Splash. He is the head chef of the Tangerino Grill. 
When Mario arrives at Tangerino Grill, the kitchen is attacked by a troupe of mischievous Shy Guys. Mario must save the chef from a Shy Guy who is jumping on him. Due to the injuries that a Shy Guy gave him, he is unable to make Mamma Mia Pizza for the customers. He has Mario take his place as the head chef, and explains to him three steps to make the Mamma Mia Pizza. Once Mario finishes that pizza, the chef tells him to spy on the customers' reactions. The chef is satisfied with the results, and is completely healed when he eats a slice of the pizza.
The chef becomes angry when he learns that a VIP customer had been kept waiting. He tells Mario to help the VIP, as he says that, though his body is healed, he is not mentally prepared to help the VIP. The chef congratulates Mario after he makes food that satisfies the VIP, as he never accepts any of his food. He is also happy that he gave the restaurant a rating of a star and a half. The chef is seen alongside the restaurant host and a yellow Toad holding a mixing bowl in the "This Here's Paint Country!" dance. 
When Mario thaws the freezer out with the Hair Dryer, the chef placed the last piece of Mamma Mia Pizza into it. He tells Mario that he will be sad when the pizza is finally gone.
In Paper Mario: The Origami King, a Toad who resembles the Tangerino Grill Chef known as Chef Kinopio appears.
