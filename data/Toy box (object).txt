Toy boxes are objects in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series.

Toy boxes are objects first appearing in Mario vs. Donkey Kong and its Nintendo Switch remake. They appear in every Mini-Mario level. When the player starts a Mini-Mario level, two Toads appear, carrying a toy box. They then both throw it in the sky, and it drops to the ground in an area of the Mini-Mario level. When Mario successfully retrieves all the Mini-Marios in the level, he must lure all of them into the toy box. After this, Mario has to first close and lock the toy box by jumping on top of it, and then the player must press  to carry it up high as they complete the level.
In the remake, Mario simply needs to lure the Mini-Marios into the toy box then press  to obtain it, as it will close on its own after the Mini-Marios are led into the toy box itself. They will also appear chained with a silver lock in multiplayer, which requires a silver flying key to unlock before it can be used.

Toy boxes are objects appearing in the minigame levels of Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem!. In odd-numbered attractions, there are two types of toy boxes: score boxes have a red border, yellow sides, and a star on the front, while Minus Boxes have a grey border, black sides, and a red X symbol on the front. Dropping a Mini of any character into a score box earns points according to the multiplier below the score box, which is applied to the number of points that the Mini type is worth. Dropping Minis into a Minus Box instead subtracts points according to the Minus Box's multiplier. In even-numbered attractions, toy boxes instead feature a Mini's face on them, and dropping a Mini of a certain character into its corresponding toy box earns 100 points, while dropping a Mini into the incorrect toy box does not earn or subtract any points.
