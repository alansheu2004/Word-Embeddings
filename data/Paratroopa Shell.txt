The Paratroopa Shell (originally known as the Troopa Shell) is a weapon for Mario in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. It is the empty shell of a Paratroopa with its wings still intact. It acts exactly like a stronger version of the Koopa Shell, and as such a Timed Hit can be performed by pressing the button as Mario kicks the shell forward after he kicks it upwards. The Paratroopa Shell has an attack power of 50 points with a random variation of up to five points above and below. It can be obtained from the shop in Seaside Town once Speardovich is removed for 90 coins. A unique variation on this shell is the Lazy Shell, which has a much higher base attack power as well as a much higher variation.
While empty Paratroopa Shells do not appear in other games, Koopa Paratroopas in the Paper Mario series duck into their shells to attack, thus appearing as Paratroopa Shells. Additionally, one design of the Spiny Shell in the Mario Kart series resembles a spiked Paratroopa Shell, despite ostensibly belonging to a Spiny.
