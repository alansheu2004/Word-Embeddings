An Artichoker is an artichoke-like monster that resembles an ordinary shrub, appearing in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. However, it has tiny legs instead of roots, allowing it to move. The plant creature also has a fish-like head that remains hidden behind its leaves. Both the legs and the head are revealed when an Artichoker attacks. Artichokers can be found in Booster Pass, where most of the time they remain stationary, appearing to be normal shrubs.
Also, an Artichoker has two primary attacks when engaged in combat. The first is causing damage by scuttling around on its feet. It can also shoot bubbles that cause damage on contact. Additionally, Artichokers can use the lightning attack Static Electricity or poison party members with Stench. If an Artichoker is hit with a special attack, it will use Recover to heal itself or other enemies on the battlefield.
Another plant-based monster, the Carroboscis, also resides in Booster Pass but is not related to the Artichoker. A more powerful variant of Artichoker, known as Kriffid, can be found in Land's End and Bean Valley.
