Golden Passage is the last level before the final boss, the Golden Diva, in Wario Land 4. It is found in the Golden Pyramid. This level can only be played once Wario has defeated all four bosses in the main passages. This level is very different and is made far more challenging than the others because the vortex drops Wario directly onto the switch upon entering the level (like Palm Tree Paradise in S-Hard mode). Therefore, the player must obtain the Keyzer and all four jewel pieces within a strict time limit in order to progress to the final boss. Some enemies that are otherwise exclusive to the Sapphire Passage reappear in this level, including Skeleton Birds, Men'onos, and Miniculas. This is also the only level to feature chandeliers. Like Hall of Hieroglyphs, there is no CD to collect in this level. Golden Passage is the only level in S-Hard mode where Wario begins with four hearts instead of one. 
The time given to escape the level after hitting the switch varies between game modes, including 9:30 in Normal mode, 6:00 in Hard, and 3:30 in S-Hard.
The actual soundtrack of Golden Passage exists, but it cannot be heard because the usual fast-paced switch music will play throughout the whole level instead. Avoiding the switch cannot be done during normal gameplay, although it is possible with an Action Replay or another hacking device. (Such devices have also revealed that the reason the switch cannot normally be avoided is that it is surrounded by invisible walls that only despawn once the switch is pressed.) The player can also do a frame-perfect pause at the beginning to hear the song. The unused soundtrack can be heard in the Media section below.
