The West Balcony is a room in the Treacherous Mansion in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. This room provides an entrance to the top of the Dark Age Exhibit.
The area is just a balcony. It provides a view to the Front Entrance, letting Luigi see the top of it. It is made out of stone, with most of the guard rails shattered, and has a farm in it with a tree and a few pumpkins. The tree has a few Crows, and the pumpkins, when sucked up with the Poltergust 5000 and thrown at a wall, reveal 5 coins. It provides a hole near the floor that can see into the upper part of the Front Entrance, and also a view to the Space Exhibit.

In A Train to Catch, when the Space Exhibit is viewed after the Strong Poltergeist has taken the yellow book, Luigi can see the Strong Poltergeist looking at the book and rotating it, never noticing him. This is a hint to where to go fight the Strong Poltergeist. The West Balcony is a completely optional room, with Luigi never having to go there to complete the game.
