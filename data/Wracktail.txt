Wracktail is a giant, lavender robotic dragon that appears in Super Paper Mario. He stated that he was a wrathful god who was locked away by the Tribe of Ancients, and Tippi says that he was the prototype for Fracktail, who looks identical to Wracktail except for his color. Before the fight, he expresses anger at the heroes for disturbing his slumber and decides to kill them in turn. Wracktail is found at the bottom of the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials and upon his defeat, Dashell, a Pixl, is obtained, and a Pipe appears, leading Mario and company back to the entrance of the Pit. Just as Fracktail is the Super Paper Mario equivalent of Hooktail from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Wracktail is the counterpart to Bonetail.
To defeat Wracktail, the same tactics must be utilized as those used to defeat Fracktail. The player must wait for the boss to dive low along the ground, then jump on his back and use Thoreau to grab the Wrackles and throw them and Wracktail's antenna, which must be hit 30 times to defeat the dragon. It is also possible to damage the antenna by stomping it, either via Luigi's super jump, or by landing on it when Wracktail flies in a loop.
Upon defeat, Wracktail warns the heroes that he was not the only monster created by the Ancients, referring to Shadoo, and directs them to the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials.
