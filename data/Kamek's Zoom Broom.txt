Kamek's Zoom Broom is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It debuted in the Kamek Tour. As its name indicates, it is the signature kart of Kamek and it resembles Kamek's broomstick with his wand at the front. It later became the signature kart of Rosalina (Halloween) in the Space Tour. It uses a new set of dark blue tires with rainbow swirly rims, and the emblem appears at the front of the kart. Like the Splat Buggy and Inkstriker from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, this vehicle has unique exhaust effects when getting a speed boost, being the magical effects seen in Magikoopas' spells; however, it had the flame exhaust effect prior to the version 2.10.0 update due to a bug, although the trailer and official screenshots for the Kamek Tour had properly shown the magical effects. Kamek's Zoom Broom increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the number of points awarded for performing Jump Boosts.
A black and orange variant named the Magma Broom, and a blue, cyan, and yellow variant named the Star Broom, made their debuts in the Sky Tour and are also classified as High-End karts. Starting from the 2022 Yoshi Tour, Kamek's Zoom Broom is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe.
