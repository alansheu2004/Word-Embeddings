Hadrian's Arch (in Greek: Πύλη του Αδριανού, Pýli̱ tou Adrianoú; also known as the Arch of Hadrian) is a famous gateway in Athens.  The Arch serves to distinguish the center of Athens from the former Hadrianopolis, indicated by two inscriptions on the arch.

Luigi visits it in the PC and SNES versions of Mario is Missing! when it gets attacked by Koopa Troopas, who steal the Arch's Brass Plaque (holding one of the inscriptions). Luigi's task is to find the Plaque, which he eventually does, and return it to the Arch, which he does through its information booth while also answering questions about the Arch (seen below).

Hadrian's Arch, alongside many of Athens' other landmarks, appear in the course Athens Dash and its additional routes and variants. In the first route for the course, racers drive beneath the arch to access a cannon.
