The Czar Dragon is a dragon made out of many Lava Babbles and the boss of the Barrel Volcano, who is guarding the sixth Star Piece in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. The dragon first appears when a group of Lava Babbles join together to form it, and it immediately attacks the party. The dragon is physically strong and uses a small variety of powerful magic, most notable of them Flame Wall. It will also summon Helio to kamikaze-strike the party, similar to Punchinello. In the end, the dragon falls, but it promptly rises from the grave as Zombone. Mario and friends must fight an even more difficult battle, but prevail and acquire the Star Piece, only to have it snatched by the Axem Rangers.
"Czar" is a Russian title meaning "Emperor," derived from the title "Caesar" used during the Roman Empire. "Kaiser," the Japanese name for the dragon, comes from the German word for "Emperor," which was also derived from the title of "Caesar". The Czar Dragon resembles the Blargg species from Super Mario World.
