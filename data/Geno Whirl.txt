Geno Whirl is an attack Geno learns at Level 11 in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and the remake. The attack involves Geno throwing a disc of light that follows a straight path to and through the enemy. In the SNES version, the disc is a solid round shape, while in the remake, it resembles a circular saw blade. Geno Whirl is notable for being one of the most powerful attacks in the game; if the player pushes  right as the attack leaves the screen, 9999 damage is dealt to the enemy. This strategy however does not work on bosses (except for some of King Calamari's tentacles, Speardovich mirages, and Exor); the chest monsters (Huhwhat, Whuhoh, Pleaseno, and Comeon); clones created by Belome and Magikoopa; Machine Made copies of bosses, and Shy Rangers. Special enemies in the game's remake are also immune to critical hits from Geno Whirl. The attack must be timed precisely; otherwise it will do an unimpressive amount of damage. Geno Whirl costs eight Flower Points to use and is one of the few magic attacks Geno can perform that does not instruct the player beforehand. Geno Whirl has the distinction of being the only special move in Mario's party that inflicts critical damage.
