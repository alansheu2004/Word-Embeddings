Blazing Shroobs are Shroobs that appear in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. The appear as red with yellow spots, and are usually seen on fire. Blazing Shroobs can be found in Thwomp Caverns.

Blazing Shroobs have different attack patterns depending on if their head is on fire or not; the fire can be put out by an Ice Flower or a jump attack from Mario or Luigi, although jumping will damages the bro that attempts this. When not on fire, a Blazing Shroob can only attack by firing its ray gun just like normal Shroobs, albeit faster; like all instances, this can be dodged by jumping. A Blazing Shroob that is "put out" will eventually catch fire again after a few turns.
When a Blazing Shroob is on fire, it can use several other attacks, all of which can cause the Burn status. It may shoot fireballs at the Mario Bros. using both hands. If it uses its right hand, the Blazing Shroob will target Mario; if it uses its left hand, it throw one at Luigi. A Shroob saucer may join the battle as well, and will often light firecrackers with the Blazing Shroob's flame before firing the explosive at a brother. This attack can be dodged by jumping, and the firecrackers will be the same shape and color as their target (skinny and green for Luigi, wide and red for Mario).
These Shroob saucers can be knocked out of the battle if Mario or Luigi jump on the Blazing Shroob under it; as they jump up in pain, they will inadvertently collide with the saucer and knock it away. Additionally, if a Blazing Shroob is defeated, the Shroob saucer above it will shift and hover over to one of the remaining Blazing Shroobs; if all Blazing Shroobs are defeated, it will leave the battlefield.
