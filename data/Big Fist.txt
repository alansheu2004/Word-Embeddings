The Big Fist is an item that Wario can purchase from the Item Shop in Wario Land 4. It can be bought off the shop owner, for ten medals in Normal difficulty, fifteen in Hard difficulty, and twenty medals in S-Hard difficulty. All items from the Item Shop are there to assist Wario in defeating a boss by doing pre-damage at the battle's start. When purchased, the shop owner will follow Wario to the boss room. She will the transform into a big fist. The fist will swing a powerful punch at the boss, although the damage varies depending on the boss, it is most effective against Cuckoo Condor, dealing twelve points of damage. After punching the boss, the shop owner exits the room and Wario is left to challenge a greatly weakened boss.
