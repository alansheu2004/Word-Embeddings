Chef Toad is a Toad character who appears as the head chef of Toadstool Cafe at Super Nintendo World. His red cap is similar to the Super Mushroom's design used since Super Mario World.
Chef Toad appears in an animated video presented as a window from a waiting area into the kitchen of the caf√©. In the video, the chef walks into view and begins preparing food, then notices guests through the window, greets them, and introduces them to the restaurant.
According to the Super Nintendo World website, the Super Mushroom Pizza Bowl with Mushroom Tomato Sauce is Chef Toad's secret recipe.
Chef Toad is one of the several characters to receive official Super Nintendo World merchandise (a plush, a figure, a key chain, and a risotto set), which can be purchased at the 1-UP Factory.
Chef Toad and Chef Kinopio from Paper Mario: The Origami King share a name in Japanese.
