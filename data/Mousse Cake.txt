A Mousse Cake (known as a Mousse in Super Paper Mario) is a recipe found in the Paper Mario series.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Mousse Cake is made by Zess T., and is made by cooking Cake Mix by itself. The item restores fifteen FP.
Sometime during the events of the game, a Bub-ulb from Petalburg sends a trouble from the Trouble Center for Mario to get two Hot Dogs and a Mousse Cake for himself. If Mario gives the requested items to it, the Bub-ulb will give Mario an unlimited supply of Dried Bouquets in exchange for Hot Dogs.
In Super Paper Mario, Mousse is made by Dyllis. It is a fluffy confection that fills 15 HP and cures Poison. It is made by mixing a Cake Mix with a Big Egg or a Honey Jar. Combining a Chocolate Cake with a Mousse will result in a Gingerbread House.
