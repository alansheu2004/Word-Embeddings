The Three Musty Fears (originally 3 "Musty Fears") are a group of undead characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Their name is a pun on the title of the novel The Three Musketeers. The Three Musty Fears consist of Boo, Dry Bones, and Greaper. They appear in Mario's dream when he sleeps in a bed located in Monstro Town, telling him to find their three flags that they hid all over Mario's world. The Dry Bones Flag is located under Mario's bed inside Mario's Pad, the Boo Flag is located between the "O" and "A" in "GOAL" at the end of the track at Yo'ster Isle, and the Greaper Flag is located behind the flower sign in Rose Town. Once all of those flags are gathered and Mario rests in the same bed, he receives a Ghost Medal from the Three Musty Fears. If he is currently holding an Accessory, it is replaced by the Ghost Medal in the Equip menu. If he sleeps in the bed again, the Three Musty Fears appear and mention if Mario is wearing the medal or not.
