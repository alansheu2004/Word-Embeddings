World 5-4 is the fourth level of World 5 in Super Mario 3D Land. The level takes place in an underground maze-like area.

Mario falls in a hole, and is spotlighted. Going to the right, crossing two Morty Moles, Mario will find a Monty Mole. Ahead, Mario will enter in a maze with different paths, leading to items. The below path takes him to a place with more Morty Moles. Going up, Mario can break Brick Blocks and, going down, touch a Checkpoint Flag. In front of it, a hole with many coins is seen. When Mario falls on this hollow, he goes to a wet place with three Monty Moles, a rectangular ? Block and a shallow pond with wooden pipes and a Warp Pipe guarded by a Rocky Wrench. This pipe leads to a room with a + Clock, many coins and an item. After the pond, Mario must go in a narrow hollow with five Monty Moles and five Morty Moles. He will reach on a room with five Warp Pipes, four of them lead to another one. The second one takes the plumber to an outdoors area with a Morty Mole and the Goal Pole.
