The Boo Woods is a location first featured in Luigi's Mansion. The Boo Woods is extremely large and full of many dead trees; E. Gadd's lab is found here along with the mansion Luigi “won”. The Boo Woods also appears in Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart Tour; in these games it has a large swamp and some of the trees can move around. As the name implies, Boos haunt this area along with the leader of this area, King Boo.

The Boo Woods is first named when Elvin Gadd of the past mentions it in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. After his lab is destroyed by the volcano of Thwomp Volcano, he says he's got "a hankering to do some paranormal research" and that he plans to move to "an affordable lab at the edge of the Boo Woods".

Prior the events of Luigi's Mansion, Mario goes to the Boo Woods to go to a mansion that Luigi owns, waiting for his brother to meet him there. However, he goes missing. In the beginning of the game, Luigi goes to the Boo Woods to find his mansion he won in a contest he did not enter. In the game, the Boo Woods appears more like a background than an actual location. Luigi can go outside to the courtyards of the mansion, where the Boo Woods is seen. The woods can also be seen in the balcony of the mansion.

In Mario Super Sluggers, Luigi's stadium is set within the Boo Woods, located in front of the mansion. Dead trees surround the ballpark, and the outfield contains gravestones and ghosts which serve as obstacles to fielders.

The Boo Woods make appearances in Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart 7, and Mario Kart Tour in the Luigi's Mansion course. Outside the mansion is the Boo Woods, which has a graveyard surrounding the mansion and beyond it, a swamp of mud with Walking Trees that act as obstacles.
