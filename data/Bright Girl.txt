The Bright Girl is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It is the signature kart of Poochy, debuting in the 2023 Yoshi Tour. The kart is a variant of the Birthday Girl featuring a pastel-colored paint scheme with Easter egg patterns, flowers on the front and rear bows, and a blue seat. Unlike the Birthday Girl and akin to the Festival Girl, it uses a pastel blue version of the Karp Kart's tires. Also unlike the Birthday Girl, the Bright Girl kart offers longer lasting Jump Boost speed boosts and increases the number of bonus points awarded for performing Jump Boosts.

The Bright Girl is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it does not currently appear in the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows its availability by tour.
