The Steel Driver is a kart in the Mario Kart series. Its name is a pun on the game Steel Diver. In fact, its Japanese and Italian names are the Steel Diver. It is a submarine-like vehicle with a dark blue top and a red underside. When the kart goes underwater, the propeller appears in the rear guard, much like an actual submarine. The emblem is located on the sides of the kart, resembling eyes. 

The Steel Driver debuts in Mario Kart 8 as an unlockable kart body. It has the same stats as the Badwagon, the Tri-Speeder, the Standard ATV, and the GLA. It boosts weight and traction, but lowers acceleration and handling.
In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it is now available from the start. In this game, it boosts speed and weight, but lowers acceleration and handling. It now shares stats with only the Tri-Speeder and Bone Rattler. CPU Iggy, Koopa Troopa, Dry Bones, and Wiggler are occasionally seen using this kart, paired with the Metal tires.

The Steel Driver returns in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a High-End kart and uses the Pirate Sushi Racer's tires. It was added at the start of the 2020 Mario vs. Luigi Tour and became the signature kart of Penguin Luigi in the Snow Tour. The Steel Driver increases the duration of Slipstream boosts and the amount of points earned for performing Slipstreams.
Since its introduction in the 2020 Mario vs. Luigi Tour, the Steel Driver has appeared in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. Below are additional availabilities for this kart, listed by tour.
