The Countdown Timer (or just the timer), also known as the counter, is a feature in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (and its reissue), Yoshi's Island DS, and Yoshi's New Island. This feature is first explained in the level Welcome To Yoshi's Island. If a Yoshi takes damage, Baby Mario (or any other baby in Yoshi's Island DS) flies away in a bubble and starts crying, and the timer begins, indicating how long star power can protect him. The timer turns from white to red when it falls below ten (in Yoshi's Island DS, the timer turns yellow below ten seconds and red in the last three seconds). If the Countdown Timer reaches zero, a few Toadies come and steal Baby Mario (or whichever baby is riding on the Yoshi's back in Yoshi's Island DS), and the player loses a life.
The Countdown Timer stops when the Yoshi retrieves the baby, and the timer slowly restores to ten seconds if it is nine or less. Stars add one more second to the timer, and Checkpoint Rings add ten more seconds, up to 30. If the player has reached the maximum, any extra stars released from Winged Clouds and tulips are replaced by coins. The Countdown Timer also plays a part in determining the score for completing a level, with a point awarded for each second left on the timer.
In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and its reissue, in addition to collecting individual stars to increase the timer, the Yoshis can use items called 10-Point Stars and 20-Point Stars.
