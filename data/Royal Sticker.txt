The Royal Stickers are six special stickers that first appear in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Kersti is their guardian, and they appear to be housed in the Sticker Comet which is the source of all other stickers. Royal Stickers can grant wishes and powers to anyone who wields them, which may also alter their personality and cause them to lose control of their powers, as shown by the bosses in the game who wear them.

On the night of the Sticker Fest, Bowser touched the Sticker Comet and scattered the Royal Stickers across the lands. Mario and Kersti travel to five lands to reclaim the stickers: the grasslands of World 1, the sunbaked desert of World 2, the dark woods of World 3, the snowy mountain of World 4 and the volcanic island of World 5, battling Bowser's minions to save the five Royal Stickers. The final and most powerful sticker lands on Bowser's head.

The bosses guarding the other five are Megasparkle Goomba (World 1), Tower Power Pokey (World 2), Gooper Blooper (World 3), Mizzter Blizzard (World 4) and Petey Piranha (World 5). Each boss has a rhyming story about their background before they received the Sticker, as well as how they got it. Once a boss is defeated, Mario must pick up the Royal Sticker to complete the world and move on to the next. If Mario tries to leave without the Royal Sticker, Kersti forces him to collect it.
The Royal Stickers and their locations are as follows:

The Royal Stickers make a few cameo appearances in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. The red Royal Sticker's likeness is used in the design of the Papercraft Megacrinkle Goomba, which seems to have been designed after the similarly named Megasparkle Goomba. Later, the trio of Mario, Luigi and Paper Mario fight Big Pokey and Tower Power Pokey as bosses; the Tower Power Pokey appears to be wearing the second Royal Sticker once again, with the orange gem on top replaced by an orange spike. 
The final Royal Sticker also appears on a Battle Card, being worn by Shiny Paper Bowser.
