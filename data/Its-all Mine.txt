Its-all Mine (parsed Itsall Mine in the British English version) is the third level of Rocking Range in Wario Land: Shake It!

Like Stonetooth Cave, the level contains a multitude of Conveyor Belts. The cave also has some fossils and stalactites protruding from the ceiling. Many Bomb Blocks are also located here. The area also has a haven of Pitchforks, which can be used to reach treasures. The golden enemy here also happens to be a golden Pitchfork. After Wario locates the caged Merfle through the use of Certainty Switches and conveyor belts, Wario will need to scurry back to the start before time expires.
