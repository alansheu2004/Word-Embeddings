The Pumpkin Kart is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2020 Halloween Tour and is the signature kart of Mario (Halloween). The kart is a jack-o'-lantern-themed variant of the Apple Kart with green wheel trucks and rims surrounding the seat and taillights, a green and purple steering wheel, a purple exhaust pipe, yellow highlights on the taillights, and a purple bat picture on the seat. Unlike the Apple Kart, it uses the Wood tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Also unlike the Apple Kart, this kart increases the duration of Mini-Turbo boosts and the number of points earned upon performing Mini-Turbos. The overall theme of the kart resembles that of the Trickster.
The game introduces a golden variant simply called the Gold Pumpkin Kart, which was introduced in the 2021 Halloween Tour and also has the High-End classification.

The Pumpkin Kart has only appeared in certain pipes and is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows the kart's availability by tour.
