Blimp Yoshi is one of Yoshi's power-ups in Super Mario Galaxy 2, along with Dash Yoshi and Bulb Yoshi. When Yoshi eats a Blimp Fruit, he turns light blue and expands like a balloon. In this state, Yoshi can float upwards for a brief period of time. Blimp Yoshi has a small meter that tells how long his powers will last, similar to that of Bee Mario, but the meter does not stop when Blimp Yoshi stops, unlike with Bee Mario. Blimp Yoshi has very limited actions in comparison to Dash Yoshi or Bulb Yoshi; Blimp Yoshi cannot open his mouth to eat enemies or items, but he can eat fruits if he floats over and touches them. By doing this, Blimp Yoshi can refill his flight meter. He cannot use Launch Stars, enter pipes, or flutter-jump. When floating, Blimp Yoshi can float without moving up if the  button is held, but this does not affect the meter and it continues to run out but at a slower rate. If the Wii Remote is shaken, Yoshi will return to his normal form.
