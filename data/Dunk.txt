Dunk is a rabbit basketball player in Wario Land II and the boss of Anyone for B-ball?, the final story of the fourth chapter. Dunk has a skull design on his shirt, suggesting that he is associated with the Black Sugar Gang. Dunk can turn Wario into a ball and throw him into a basketball hoop, although Wario can do this too and wins if done three times. Dunk also attacks by throwing basketballs, which both open Wario up to be jumped on and revert him back to normal.
In Wario Land 3, a similar character who is possibly related to Dunk appears, the soccer-playing boss Shoot.
