A Lava Lift, also called a Skull Raft, is a raft of skulls that debuted in Super Mario World. It is the precursor to the segmented platform.

Skull Rafts are objects in Super Mario World. They allow Mario and Luigi to travel across lava rivers. Blarggs sometimes appear on these paths to try and attack the player character, requiring them to jump before landing back onto the Skull Raft safely.

Skull Rafts, now known as Lava Lifts, are objects in Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS. This appearance is different than in Super Mario World. They are able to move in the air on top of moving in lava. Skull Rafts can be used in all four styles, featuring new sprites for the Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 designs, and a 2.5D model for New Super Mario Bros. U. A faster blue variant also exists, and it does not fall off the screen after a couple seconds. The rafts are generally used to follow tracks.

Lava Lifts are objects in Super Mario Maker 2. The blue ones are now distinctly referred to as Fast Lava Lifts.

A Skull Raft appears in the episode "Mama Luigi" of the Super Mario World television series. Here, it shows that the Skull Raft is made of both wood and skulls, not just skulls like in the video game. In Luigi's story, he gets attacked by a Fire Sumo and falls into the Lava Pits. However, he lands on a Skull Raft, which saves his life. However, the raft approaches a lava waterfall, and the two fall down. At the bottom, the Skull Raft floats away from the ground that Luigi lands on.
