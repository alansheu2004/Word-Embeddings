Checkpoint blocks are objects in Wario Land: Shake It! Wario can hit one of these blocks to save his progress up to that point for every level. Checkpoint blocks almost always appear right before the imprisoned Merfle. They are very useful to hit, for should Wario either lose all of his HP or not make it back to the start of the level in the given time, he pops out of that block if the player chooses to retry the level. Also, if Wario does not collect enough coins or treasure to his liking, or should he take damage on the way back with a Merfle, or any other type of mission that needs to be completed, he can restart the level from the start of that block at his will. However, some levels have a mission that states that the player should not hit the checkpoint block, and they have to complete the level without hitting it to clear the mission.
