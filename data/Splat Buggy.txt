The Splat Buggy is one of the four additional vehicle bodies in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe not present in the original game. It is one of the two All-Terrain Vehicles based on the Splatoon series, meaning that it is one of the Inklings' signature vehicles, the other being the Inkstriker. The vehicle looks nearly identical to the Standard ATV, but with a different frontal styling, a slimmer body, and equipped with a tank of ink on the back. The emblem is located on the right side of the ATV. Much like the Inkstriker, the exhaust pipes spray ink when getting a speed boost. The ink colors differ depending on the color of the Inkling. For every other character, it uses the magenta Inkling Girl's color scheme, with the Super Mario franchise Super Mushroom emblem embedded instead of the Splatoon-themed arrows and a Blooper on the front left fin; however Link, the Male and Female Villagers and Isabelle also have the Super Mario symbols on their versions of the Splat Buggy, despite them coming from a different series. It is available from the start.
The Splat Buggy shares its stats with the Blue Falcon. It boosts speed, while reducing the weight, acceleration and handling stats. The stat changes are mostly minor, with the biggest change being the reduction in weight.
The vehicle shares its engine sound with the Standard Kart, Pipe Frame, Gold Standard, Teddy Buggy and Wild Wiggler, sounding like a Subaru Impreza WRC 2.0L Turbo flat-four engine. When idle, the sputtering of the engine sounds similar to a shooter firing ink from the Splatoon games.
CPU-controlled Inkling Boys and Inkling Girls occasionally use this vehicle body paired with Standard tires. The 200cc staff ghost in Dragon Driftway plays as Inkling Boy with the Splat Buggy and Blue Standard tires.
