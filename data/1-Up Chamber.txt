1-Up Chambers, or 1-Up Rooms, are sub-areas that are accessed through certain Warp Pipes in Super Mario World. 1-Up Chambers consist of five horizontal floorboards, each with three Prize Blocks within it. If Mario or Luigi jumps onto a floorboard, he cannot return to the one below him. The topmost floorboard has a Warp Pipe leading back into the main level. With each tier, the object is to jump at the Prize Blocks in a certain order, which is always randomized. If Mario or Luigi jumps at the correct first and second Prize Blocks each, he earns a coin, followed by a 1-Up Mushroom in the third Prize Block. Jumping at the first one or two Prize Blocks in the correct order turns each one into an O/X BlockMedia:OX Block.png. If Mario or Luigi jumps at a Prize Block in the incorrect order, every Prize Block in its row turns into a Brown Block. There is an exploit where the player character can always hit each row's Prize Blocks in the correct order while in Caped form, by performing a Spin Jump on the left side of each Prize Block from left to right. This method does not work in the GBA version. 1-Up Chambers appear in the following locations:
