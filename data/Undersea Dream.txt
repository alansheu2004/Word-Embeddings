Undersea Dream in Mario Party 5 is a board map from the Dream Depot. It was created from dreams of the ocean. The flavor text in the instruction booklet references Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Resembling a coral reef, the board is divided into two sections connected by bridges. Noteworthy features are the sunken ship, the whale, and the tiny shops set up by Cheep Cheeps. If a player lands on the Happening Space on the sunken ship, a dolphin swims out and forcefully takes the player to another part of the board. Landing on the Happening Space next to the whale allows players to be blasted to a space nearer to the Star; however, it is also possible to be blasted in front of the Star, meaning that the player will have to go all the way around the board again to get it. The Happening Space next to the Cheep Cheep on the right-side reef let players get a chance to earn a Capsule, an empty can, or an old boot from one of the shells (with the latter two being worth nothing). Finally, the Happening Spaces next to the logs on either side of the board gave players a chance to ride a manta to the other side of the board and collect coins along the way.
