Stock is a high-level informant who is held captive and forced to work for Mimi in Super Paper Mario. Along with fellow captive Cade, his name derives from "stockade", a colloquial term for a military prison.
In the room filled with captives, Stock can be found by flipping into 3-D. By paying him 10,000 Rubees, he reveals the pass code for the safe filled with 1,000,000 Rubees. He does not realize it is for the safe and assumes it is Mimi's boyfriend's phone number instead.
Later, after Mimi leaves the mansion, he realizes information is useless except for people who need it. Then he begs the heroes to tell him how to get out of the mansion, offering to pay them for that info.
