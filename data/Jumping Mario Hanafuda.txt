The Jumping Mario Hanafuda is a glider that appears in Mario Kart Tour. It is a variant of the Baby Mario Hanafuda with a hanafuda-style drawing of Mario jumping on a Goomba and is classified as a tour-exclusive High-End glider. Unlike the Baby Mario Hanafuda, hitting opponents with Red Shells awards more points when using this glider. The artwork depicted on it is taken directly from the Mario Hanafuda deck, and it was added in the month the artwork was used for in the set, November.
The glider could be unlocked during the Sunset Tour, where it was part of a tour gift for Gold Pass members after getting 200 Grand Stars.
