The Giga Bob-omb is the special item of Purple Toad (Pit Crew), Peach (Yukata), Cat Luigi, King Bob-omb, and Shy Guy (Gold) as well as the King Bob-omb and Purple Mii Racing Suits in Mario Kart Tour. When used, it bounces forward on the course for a brief time before exploding, producing a blast radius much larger than that of a regular Bob-omb. Unlike regular Bob-ombs, the Giga Bob-omb cannot be thrown backwards, and if held for too long, it will automatically explode, knocking out the user; as such, it can only be thrown forward within a certain amount of time before it automatically explodes. When Giga Bob-omb+ is active, the Giga Bob-omb is even larger than before, and it has a bigger blast radius.
Appearance-wise, the Giga Bob-omb is very different from a normal Bob-omb, having a more bluish color, a menacing glare, and even more mechanical-looking legs and feet. It also has a furnace-like cage that resembles a mouth just below its eyes, and it is almost four times bigger than a regular Bob-omb (almost twice the size of King Bob-omb himself).
