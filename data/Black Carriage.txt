The Black Carriage is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2022 Anniversary Tour and is the signature kart of Luigi (Lederhosen). Much like the Happy Ride, the kart is based on the Ghost Ride, although its grille is redesigned to make the kart resemble a Hackney carriage. It also has taxi signs at the front and back of the vehicle and uses the Slim tires from Mario Kart 7. The Black Carriage increases the duration of Dash Panel boosts and the number of points earned for using a Dash Panel.

The Black Carriage is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and it does not currently appear in the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows its availability by tour.
