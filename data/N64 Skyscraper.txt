Skyscraper is a battle course in Mario Kart 64. As its name implies, the course takes place on the roof of a giant skyscraper. It is the currently the only battle course in the Mario Kart series to have a one-word name, and one of two courses in general with this distinction (the other being Electrodrome, a race course from Mario Kart 8).

The course's layout is octagon-shaped and composed of an outer ring and a much wider inner ring, separated by a large gap. There is also a hole at the center of the inner ring. Four bridges connect the inner and outer rings and have walls on the side, however there are no other walls anywhere on the course, making it easy for players to fall off the map and lose balloons.

Skyscraper returns in Mario Kart Wii. In the stage's Wii version, it was made larger to accommodate 12 players. The edges of the gaps in the roof became ramps on which players can perform tricks. Areas 1-4 are also re-ordered clockwise instead of having 1-2 and 3-4 parallel to each other (based on players' starting positions), and have become color-coded yellow, green, cyan, and magenta.

September 2008's first tournament required players to complete a Time Trial on a version of Skyscraper whose outer ring has been turned into a race track: Players must drive three laps counterclockwise around the outer ring, though there are now fourteen Bob-omb Cars and four Item Boxes traveling clockwise. Players start the Time Trial with no items, but each Item Box would guarantee either a Mushroom, Mega Mushroom, or Super Star. The control scheme was restricted to Wii Wheel users. The tournament was later repeated as the first tournament of September 2010, the first tournament of February 2012, and the second tournament of April 2013.
