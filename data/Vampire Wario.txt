Vampire Wario is a reaction of Wario's which first appears in Wario Land 3.

In Wario Land 3, Vampire Wario can be triggered by coming in contact with a Kobatto, causing Wario to become a vampire. He is then able to defeat any enemy upon contact which can be used to get foes blocking Wario's path such as Prince Froggy. He is also able to float over and jump from the surface of water. By pressing  on the ground, he can become Bat-Wario, who is capable of flight, but is smaller and can only slowly make fluttering leaps while on the ground rather than walking. To turn back to his normal self, he must touch a head of garlic, go into a patch of light, or touch a droplet of water (similar to Zombie Wario), meaning that if Vampire Wario is required in another part of the level, the aforementioned objects are basically obstacles. Vampire Wario cannot cross waterfalls, unlike normal Wario.

In Dr. Mario 64, if the player is playing as Dr. Mario and has not lost or rematch at any point in normal mode or greater, Wario will eat the Megavitamins and transform into a vampire and a match will ensue. Defeating him in one battle will unlock Vampire Wario as a playable character. In multiplayer modes, Vampire Wario has the highest-level AI along with Rudy and Metal Mario. Vampire Wario's losing animation has him transform into a bat, while his winning animation has him cackling.
