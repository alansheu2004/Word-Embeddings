World 6-4 is the fourth level of World 6 in Super Mario 3D Land.

This level contains many Beat Blocks that appear and vanish in the music beat. Mario starts on a wooden platform. Going up two steps, Mario must cross three Beat Blocks to reach on another wooden platforms, containing a Wallop. Three Beat Blocks in a stair-like position connect this place to another area, where are two Prongos, three ? Blocks and another Wallop guarding a door.
Entering in the door, Mario finds a long corridor, while he is chased by a Wallop. At the end, he can jump on more beating platform until he enters in another door. The door takes Mario to an area with the Checkpoint Flag. Crossing another three Beat Blocks, Mario reaches a wood board with a red ring, and ahead, there are two narrow platforms with Wallops, just before a bigger board. Mario must traverse an S-shaped platform made of a wooden block and six arc-shaped beat platforms, while he is dodging a Spike Bar. Mario reaches on a wooden building where he faces a Prongo. Going to the right, Mario travels through two groups of Beat Blocks and another Prongo between the two. Soon, Mario can jump over three small Beat Blocks to go to the Goal Pole.
