UNDAKE30 Same Game (also known by its full title UNDAKE30 Same Game Daisakusen Mario Version) is a puzzle game developed by Hudson Soft that was released in 1995 in Japan for the Super Famicom. It is a variant of the tile-matching puzzle game SameGame with graphics themed to the Super Mario franchise.

The game can be controlled with either a standard joypad or the Super Famicom Mouse, and it is similar to the card game Monte Carlo. The game centers around a large playing field composed of a random arrangement of Mario heads, Coins, Yoshi Eggs, Fire Flowers, and Super Mushrooms. If two or more icons of the same type are connected vertically or horizontally, the player can move the cursor and double-click to make all the connected icons disappear. The icons above then fall down, potentially allowing the player to clear even more icons. There is an undo move that allows the player to take back the last move and move back as far as wanted. Once the entire grid is clear, the game ends. However, if the player ends up in a situation where no two icons of the same type touch each other, a Game Over occurs as the player is unable to make any more moves. 

The ROM cartridge is a promotional release. It was given to stores to display and to winners of game tournaments as a prize.
A more standard release was in the form of a Satellaview download, which was broadcasted Mondays at 17:30 (5:30 PM) and was accompanied by an UNDAKE30 Radio show starring Sugiyama Kazuko, the voice of Bomberman. This program aired until 1996.
