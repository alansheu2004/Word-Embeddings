Frozen Coins are objects introduced in Super Mario Bros. 3. They appear in a few games of the Super Mario series. They are coins encased in solid ice that can be melted by fire to be collected.

Frozen Coins first appear in Super Mario Bros. 3 at the end of World 6-7, and then appear throughout World 6-10. The player can melt the ice and collect the coins within by using their Fire form's fireballs. In World-e of the remake, Frozen Coins are first seen in a bonus room of Slip Slidin' Away, then throughout Ice Cubed.

Frozen Coins are objects in the level World 9-7 in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. They can also be melted by fireballs from a Fire Piranha Plant or a Fire Bro.

Frozen Coins are objects in the level Piranha Plants on Ice in New Super Mario Bros. U and the level Slippery Rope Ladders in New Super Luigi U, reprising both roles in New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. Frozen Coins appear slightly wider and with more ridges.

Frozen Coins are objects introduced in the version 2.0 update for Super Mario Maker 2. They exhibit the same behavior as in previous games. Frozen Coins can be melted by any fire-based course element except lava, and the melting process is noticeably faster as well. The spells used by the Koopalings can melt Frozen Coins in the New Super Mario Bros. U theme only. When a P Switch is activated, the Frozen Coins turn into frozen versions of Brick Blocks (Rotating Blocks in the Super Mario World style). Frozen Brick Blocks, unlike their normal counterparts, cannot be broken by Super Mario.
