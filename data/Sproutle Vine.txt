A Sproutle Vine (also shortened to Sproutle) is a type of vine found in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. The only difference between a Sproutle Vine and a normal vine is that a normal vine is straight, while a Sproutle Vine is twisted. Sproutle Vines often appear after the player defeats Piranha Plants or breaks open rocks or stone wheels.
To make Mario (or Luigi) climb a Sproutle Vine, the player must make him jump on it and shake the Wii Remote. After Mario gets to the end of the vine, he can get off by jumping or just landing on the next planet if there is one.
