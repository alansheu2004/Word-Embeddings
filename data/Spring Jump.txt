A Spring Jump is a move performed when jumping on Trampolines in the Super Mario series, Mario vs. Donkey Kong series, and Donkey Kong for the Game Boy, usually by pressing the jump button with timing when landing on them.

The move is introduced in Super Mario Bros., where it is used on jumping boards to jump over large gaps and walls.

In Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels, a successful Spring Jump on a Super Spring, a stronger version of the jumping board, causes Mario or Luigi to jump so high that they cannot be seen on-screen. World 7-3 and World C-3 make extensive use of this mechanic.

Starting in Super Mario World, Mario's can turn in the air after performing a Spring Jump.

In Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, Spring Jumps act exactly like in Super Mario World, though they can only be performed in the World-e levels Ice Dungeon and Vexing Doors, as those are the only stages featuring Trampolines.

In Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, Spring Jumps are performed by Ground Pounding the Trampoline.

In Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, Spring Jumps can be performed on the new, Trampoline-like Hop-Chop enemy.

In Super Mario Maker, Spring Jumps can be performed on Trampolines in all game styles, and they act like they did in Super Mario World.

In Super Mario Maker 2, the Hop-Chop enemy appears in the Super Mario 3D World game style, and a Spring Jump can be performed on them like in the original game.

In Donkey Kong for the Game Boy, Spring Jumps can be performed on Jump Stands by simply jumping on them.

In Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Mini-Marios automatically perform this move when approaching a spring in order to reach Mario.

In Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, the Mini Marios can perform a Spring Jump if they are swiped up when near a spring.
