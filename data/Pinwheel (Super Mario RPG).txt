Pinwheels are enemies in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. These fan-like creatures make their fighting appearance in Nimbus Land, where Mario and his party are literally blown away by this enemy. A friendly one appears in Monstro Town, inside Monstermama's house, this one acts like a fan. Pinwheels are named after the small windmill-shaped toy.
Pinwheels, according to the Pinwheel in Monstro Town, have three settings: "Breeze," "Gust," and "Blast." The "Breeze" setting is very light. The "Gust" setting is slightly harder. The "Blast" setting is the strongest setting, the Pinwheel turning a red color and blowing a strong gust of wind. The wind in Monstro Town will not push Mario back, but in Nimbus Land, it can blow him back into the next room or at a wall. The setting of the Pinwheel in Monstro Town affects the enemy Pinwheels in Nimbus Land, which is due to a psychic link according to the Player's Guide.
Pinwheels are often seen fighting alongside Sling Shys and Jawful.
