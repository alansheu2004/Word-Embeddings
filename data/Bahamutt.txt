Bahamutt is a colossal dragon encountered by Mario and his allies while exploring Bowser's Keep in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. Both Comeon and Wizakoopa can summon one to help them in battle. Bahamutt has a high amount of HP and above-average stats. Besides regular biting attacks, it can use the special moves Iron Maiden and Hot Shot. Bahamutt is named after the Bahamut, a powerful dragon from the Final Fantasy series. It is related to Yoshis, where its Japanese name is derived from Yoshi's name, sharing the name with Dorrie. Its body shape resembles Yoshi's and if a Yoshi Cookie is used on a Bahamutt, Yoshi swallows it and produces a Yoshi Candy item (which is normally earned if Yoshi fails to swallow an enemy).
Despite being very strong, Bahamutt does not appear to be very confident in its own abilities, as revealed by its thought.
There is an unused version of Bahamutt who resembles Boshi, with purplish coloration and pointed sunglasses. It can use the move Flame, though it has no thought.
