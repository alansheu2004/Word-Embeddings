The Heart Balloons are a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. They were introduced in the Valentine's Tour and became the signature glider of Monty Mole and Pauline (Party Time) in the Flower Tour and New Year's 2021 Tour respectively. The glider is a set of multi-colored heart-shaped balloons. The Heart Balloons increase the chances of getting Red Shells from Item Boxes and the number of bonus points awarded for hitting other drivers with Red Shells. 
This glider has two variants; a gold and silver variant called the Silver-and-Gold Hearts, and an Easter-themed variant called the Bright Balloons. Both gliders also have the High-End classification.

Since their introduction in the Valentine's Tour, the Heart Balloons have appeared in all regular tour pipes, however, they are not a part of the shop's Daily Selects.
