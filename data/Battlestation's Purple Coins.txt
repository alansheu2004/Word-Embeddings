Battlestation's Purple Coins is the fifth mission of the Dreadnought Galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy. Until its completion, this mission can only be done while a Purple Comet is in orbit. This Purple Coin mission does not have a time limit.

This mission has a similar style to Purple Coins on the Battlerock, and takes place along the segment outside of the Dreadnought from the mission Dreadnought's Colossal Cannons. While avoiding most of the obstacles from that mission, the player needs to collect all 100 Purple Coins lined in the course. If the player collects all of the coins and reaches the Gearmo at the end, he will reward the player with a Power Star. However, missing one or more of the coins will cause the player to lose a life and do the challenge again. 99 of the Purple Coins are found along the side of the Dreadnought, with the final coin being placed in the path of the Launch Star at the end. There is also a Sling Star at the end which also sends Mario to the Gearmo, although its path misses the last purple coin.
