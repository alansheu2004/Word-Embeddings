Dorguy the Second is the second of Queen Jaydes' guardian doors during the events of Super Paper Mario, and the only one with red eyes, rather than orange. He is found deeper in the path from The Underwhere to The Overthere than Dorguy the First. In accordance with Jaydes' orders, he must only open to trustworthy people and not let any enemies pass by like the other doors. Like Dorguy the First, he must ask the heroes several questions. His questions have to do with memorizing the shapes, colors, and moving patterns of the geometrical figures that appear on his personal screen. Unlike Dorguy the First, he does not tell the heroes if they answered a question correctly or not, and instead gives a percentage after all of the questions have been answered. His questions are a reference to the game Brain Age, and he even tells the heroes their own "Brain Age" when the questions are over. He is followed by Dorguy the Third.
