Peach Bomber is Peach's side special move in the Super Smash Bros. series, starting with Super Smash Bros. Melee. Peach twirls, then she lunges forward with her butt and blasts her opponents with an explosion on contact. In Super Smash Bros. Melee, it is a fiery explosion, but since Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the explosion is filled with hearts. It takes a while to use, which leaves her open to enemy attacks, but it travels farther as of Brawl. Peach lunges quicker as of Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U (as she does not twirl beforehand), but the move deals less damage.
In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, Peach Bomber can be customized to one of two custom variants, although they are locked first. The Flower Bomber can sprout a flower into opponents in contact. It has a faster startup, but travels a short distance. The Flying Peach Bomber can cause a large explosion upon contact with opponents, but if Peach misses, then she will have to wait for a short period of time before she can do anything else.
In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Daisy has a similar move called Daisy Bomber. It performs identically, but with flower effects instead of hearts.
