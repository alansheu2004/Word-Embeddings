Frogogs are large muscular frogs that appear in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. They are one of the first enemies encountered in the game that is completely original to it, not based on any recurring enemy from previous games.
Frogogs always fight alongside other monsters, including Goombas, Spikeys, Paratroopas, and K-9s, usually in groups of three. Frogogs predominantly live in Bandit's Way but also reside in the Pipe Vault. Frogogs are relatives of Ribbites, which appear later in Land's End and whose thought indicates that they are the Frogogs' children.
In battle, Frogogs have high HP compared to other enemies in the beginning of the game, making them one of the strongest enemies in the early stages of the game. They normally attack by biting a party member. If all other enemies have been defeated, they may instead shoot a droplet that deals 50% more damage than usual. In the original game, these droplets are blue and appear to be shot from the Frogog's eyes, while in the remake, they are green and are spat by the Frogog.
