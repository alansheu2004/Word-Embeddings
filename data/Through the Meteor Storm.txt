Through the Meteor Storm is the second mission of the Melty Molten Galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy.

The player starts back at the starting area at the base of the volcano, however, this time there are many meteors falling from the sky. Unlike the other missions, the player cannot access the other part of the starting planet due to an invisible wall preventing the player to get to the other part. Making their way around the volcano, the player has to lure a Li'l Cinder into two torches to light them up, which will cause a Launch Star to appear. The Launch Star will send Mario to an octagonal planet with three large Thwomps and meteors falling between the gaps of the planet. The Launch Star at the end will send Mario to a cooled lava area where the player has to collect five Star Chips while avoiding falling meteors and lava enemies. Collecting them all will send Mario to a U-shaped planet where the player has to lure a Bullet Bill from the opposite side of the planet back to the starting area to destroy a cage with a Launch Star. The next has a Rolling Ball the player needs to roll over lava platforms and through meteors. Near the end are large wheels of lava that turn, which affect how the ball will roll. Getting the Rolling Ball to the hole and the end will reward the player with the Power Star.
