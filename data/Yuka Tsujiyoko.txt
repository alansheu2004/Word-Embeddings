Yuka Tsujiyoko (Japanese: 辻横 由佳), born Yuka Bamba (Japanese: 辻横 馬場), is a composer who has worked mainly on Nintendo's Fire Emblem series and composed for Tetris Attack and the first two Paper Mario games. She worked at Intelligent Systems until after the release of Paper Mario, when she became independent to work on other kinds of music, though she has continued to collaborate with the company since.
Tsujiyoko first became interested in music when she took piano lessons in preschool. She composed her first original piece in high school as part of a music assignment. Tsujiyoko later studied at Osaka Electric Communication Junior College, majoring in electronics, and worked as a programmer for a software company prior to joining the video game industry and Intelligent Systems.
