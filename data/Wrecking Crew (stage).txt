Wrecking Crew is one of the selectable stages from Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which is based on the stages that appear in the original Wrecking Crew game. Similar to the original game, the stage is set in the large building with layers, along with bombs, drums, walls and ladders. When players hit the bombs, they explode, crumbling anything nearby on the same floor. Breaking these walls causes the whole layer to fall down by one, resulting in revealing another set of bombs, walls and drums. If layers with drums fall down upon a character, they become stuck in the drum; players have to wriggle in order to escape from it. Explosions from bombs can also damage players if they are in their blast radius.
The omega form of the stage takes place on top of the building. While the standard form of the stage is limited to four players, the Omega form can hold up to eight in 8-Player Smash mode.
In both for Wii U and Ultimate, the unlock match for R.O.B. takes place here.
In Ultimate, its My Music library is now shared with Summit, Duck Hunt, Hanenbow, PictoChat 2, Living Room, Balloon Fight, Tomodachi Life, Find Mii, Pilotwings, and Wuhu Island.
