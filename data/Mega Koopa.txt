The Mega Koopa is a giant Koopa Troopa in Super Paper Mario that got a Mega Star.
In Chapter 3-1, an ordinary Koopa Troopa sees Mario coming and obtains a Mega Star to stop him (using the same animations that any other character does when they use a Mega Star). Despite its size, it can be defeated by any non-jump attack (including hitting it with a normal-sized Koopa Shell), or the player can pick up the other Mega Star in the area and run into it.
If the player jumps on the Mega Koopa or picks it up with Thoreau, it will hide in its shell and can be kicked before it comes out. The shell will ricochet around the arena, dealing damage to the player until defeated. 
Despite being pixelated, the Mega Koopa is actually 3D, which can be seen when flipping. 
It is possible to Tattle the Mega Koopa by returning to the room with it once the chapter is beaten.
When the player receives 100 shop points, they are given a Catch Card of the Mega Koopa.
