S. Smash Charge, abbreviated on the menu as S. Smash Chg., is a Badge in Paper Mario. It can be bought from Rowf's Badge Shop after chapter 5 for 100 coins. If Mario equips it, he gains access to Super Charge, a hammer ability that costs 4 FP to use. It acts as a stronger version of Smash Charge; when it is used, Mario powers up his hammer attacks, increasing their strength by three points at the cost of using up his turn. If the move is used again, Mario's power is again increased by three points, stacking with the previous charge, and there is no limit to how many times he can use Super Charge. This also works in conjunction with Smash Charge. His next hammer attack automatically uses all of his accumulated charge, and the charge is lost for every subsequent hammer attack.
