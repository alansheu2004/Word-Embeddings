Fear is a status ailment found in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and  its remake. If a party member has been stricken with Fear, they begin to shiver. When a character is afraid, their attack and defense is cut in half, meaning they deal only half damage to enemies and receive approximately fifty percent more damage from enemy attacks. A Fearless Pin grants the equipped character immunity to Fear attacks.
A bloating heart will appear above a party member when an enemy's fear-inducing attack is successful, with the exception on few attacks like Sand Storm, being thrown by one of King Calamari's tentacles, and Poundette's "Fear Hammer". An exclamation mark will appear above certain enemies when a Fright Bomb item is used on or when Bowser's Terrorize attack is used successfully.  In the remake, characters with the Fear status also get surrounded by purple clouds.

Attacks marked with an asterisk (*) also cause damage, while attacks marked with double asterisks affect the entire opposition.
