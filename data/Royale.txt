The Royale is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It is based upon the rare Bugatti Royale, but pink-toned. The emblem is located on the sides of the kart.

The Royale first appears in Mario Kart DS as Peach's default signature kart. It has high acceleration and weight; very high drift and items; and low speed and handling. Its acceleration is tied with the B Dasher; its weight is tied with the 4-Wheel Cradle; and its handling is tied with the Dragonfly. The Royale can also be driven by Yoshi and Toad once the player has won a gold trophy in all Nitro or Retro cups on 150cc. To let any character use the kart, the player must win gold trophies in all cups on 150cc Mirror Mode.

The Royale returns in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a Super kart. It uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to match its appearance in Mario Kart DS, although the original trailer showed it with the Slick tires from the two games instead. The Royale offers extended Slipstream boosts and awards additional points for performing Slipstreams. This game introduces two variants, a white variant named the White Royale, and a blue variant called the Blue Royale, which are also classified as Super karts.
The kart is available in regular tour pipes and is also a part of the Daily Selects set. Throughout the game's history, it has also been obtainable through other means; the following table lists the special availability of the Royale by tour.
