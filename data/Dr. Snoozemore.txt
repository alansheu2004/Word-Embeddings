Dr. Snoozemore (parsed Dr Snoozemore in the British English version) is the proprietor of Pi'illo Island who appears in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. He studies the science of sleep on the island due to the special power that makes people sleep. He has trouble staying awake, constantly falling asleep even mid-conversation. This frustrates other characters, like Toadsworth and Starlow.

At the beginning of the game, he first appears when Broggy reveals his communication screen behind his bandage. He then talks to Mario, Luigi, Toadsworth, and Peach through it, introducing them to him and telling them to relax on their way to Pi'illo Island. During Luigi's nightmare, he also tells them about another passenger aboard the blimp, who is actually Antasma. Snoozemore is away on a business trip when they arrive at the island, but he sends another message about the history of Pi'illo Island when they arrive at Pi'illo Castle. Later in the game, he returns to the island and tells the Bros. about the Zeekeeper, the only being which can shatter the barrier guarding Neo Bowser Castle.
