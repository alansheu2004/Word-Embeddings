110m Hurdles is a track Athletics Event that appears in the Wii version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games. It is set in the National Stadium. The aim of the event is to jump the hurdles and reach the end of the track in the fastest time. Luigi, Shadow, Yoshi and Blaze can be seen competing in this event in the game's opening. The starting world record for this event is 12.88 seconds, while the starting Olympic record is 12.91 seconds.

This event starts with the character's names and lane numbers being announced before showing the characters preparing to start running. When "Ready?" appears on the screen, the player can hold down  to build up power, allowing them to perform a faster start the longer that they hold it for. When "Go!" appears, the player can swing the Wii Remote down to start running. If they do so with perfect timing, they will perform a Rocket Start and receive a much greater speed boost. However, doing so too early will cause them to perform a foul and the event to be started over. Once the player starts running, the player must quickly swing the Wii Remote and Nunchuk up and down to run faster, with their speed being shown on the meter in the top left hand corner of the screen. To jump the hurdles, the player must press  just before they reach the hurdle. Doing so with good timing will give them a short speed boost after jumping the hurdle, with the size of the boost depending on how well timed the jump was however, doing so too early or too late will cause the character to knock the hurdle over and lose speed. The number of hurdles remaining before the finish line is shown over the top of each hurdle before it is jumped. The player is also able to lead with their chest by pressing  just before the finish line to finish slightly faster.
