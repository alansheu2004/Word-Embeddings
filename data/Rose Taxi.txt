The Rose Taxi is a High-End kart appearing in Mario Kart Tour, which was added in the Peach vs. Daisy Tour alongside Pauline (Rose) and the Rose Parasol. It became the signature kart of Fire Rosalina in the Space Tour. Based on the Yellow Taxi, it has a rosey-red color scheme, a heart design on the hood and roses adorning the body. The color scheme is also slightly similar to the Red Taxi, though the silver parts have a bronze color scheme on this kart. The emblem on the hood ornament is also smaller. The Rose Taxi uses brass-rimmed versions of the Off-Road tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It raises the duration of Slipstream boosts and the amount of bonus points awarded for performing Slipstreams.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Rose Taxi is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup.
