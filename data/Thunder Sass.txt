Thunder Sass is a character that appears in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, as one of Big Massif's four Hooraw disciples that must be fought in the "Beef-off". He is a tiny, angry Hooraw with yellow spiked hair and yellow pants. Of the Hooraw disciples, Thunder Sass has the lowest HP and DEF, but has the highest SPEED and POW, with his stats referencing the Fury effect that Bowser can get in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. They appear to Mario and Dreamy Luigi at Dreamy Wakeport, sent by Big Massif to test them. When they head to the next area to hide, Thunder Sass heads down the yellow Warp Pipe.
In battle, Thunder Sass surrounds himself with Hooraws, much like his fellow Hooraw Disciples (except Beef Cloud). For this battle, Mario is only able to use counterattacks to damage him, similarly to Shrowser in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, the first few Hammer Bros in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, in the Stuff Retrieval mission, and Ludwig von Koopa in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. All of the command blocks have been removed except for the Item Block (along with the Hint Block if the player receives a Game Over), and only healing items can be used. Badge effects also cannot be used. It is also the only battle in the game in which the player can do nothing, by pressing  to become idle.
One of Thunder Sass's attacks involve him bouncing across groups of Hooraws before launching himself at Mario at high speed, but will only bounce off the groups of Hooraws that have their arms raised. Mario must use his Hammer to counterattack. This attack can inflict Mario with the Dizzy status effect. Thunder Sass will also simply charge at Mario several times with a flurry of punches, which can be countered by jumping on him. Thunder Sass moves fast during his charge attack, so he can be jumped over entirely.
