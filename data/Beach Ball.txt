Beach Balls, or simply Balls, appear in gameplay-related capacities in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins and Mario Kart Tour.

In Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, Bears roll Beach Balls under their feet, moving with them slowly from side to side. The Beach Ball continues to bounce and roll at the same speed even after the Bear on it is defeated, changing orientation when bumping into a wall. The ball can carry Mario like a moving platform. It can be so used in the level Mario the Circus Star! to pass wide spiky surfaces.

A Beach Ball appears in the Squeaky Clean Sprint course of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart Tour, floating in the water-filled bathtub along with a Toy Duck and a Hoop. It primarily serves a decorative purpose, though in Mario Kart Tour it also gives bonus points if hit with a Banana, a Giant Banana, or a Bob-omb.
