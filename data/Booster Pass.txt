Booster Pass is a small area (composed of two sections) that leads to Booster Tower in the game Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. The first section has a Lakitu prowling it and several other enemies in it. The second hidden area is like an obstacle course and in it the Apprentices train to become Booster's next Snifster.
In Mario and the Incredible Rescue, Mario, Luigi, Toad and Yoshi go through here for the Red Mushroom. However, they are attacked by Wario and his buckets.
In the Nintendo Switch remake, in the second area of the level, hidden behind a creek, a hidden NPC called the Monster List Agent has been added, where he sells Thought Peek entries missing in the Monster List for three Frog Coins each. He will also give for free the entries for the enemies that have been faced prior to Mallow joining the party: the Terrapins, Bowser, the Chaindeliers and the Hammer Bros.
