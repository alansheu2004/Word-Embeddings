A Chombone is an obstacle in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and its remake. It resembles a white invertebrate. Chombone's name is a portmanteau of "chomp" and "bone," as well as a pun on "trombone". A few Chombones appear in the Pump Works, located in Bowser's body, and can be activated by placing food in front of them. Using pipes, the player needs to maneuver the purple star-like orbs in front of them. Without water flooding the area, they are unable to move anywhere. With water, however, they can be pushed around freely until they hit an end. Doing so will allow the orbs to fall in line with the Chombones, enabling them to eat the food. The orb seems to be very spicy, as it causes them to violently react by charging in a straight line, breaking through anything that can be broken, like small bones. As a result, it allows both Mario and Luigi to continue through the Pump Works. There is also one massive Chombone that charges through a wider range of even thicker materials that block the way.
