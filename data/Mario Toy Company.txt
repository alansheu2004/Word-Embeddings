The Mario Toy Company is a company that sells Mini-Mario toys in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series. In Mario vs. Donkey Kong and its remake for the Nintendo Switch, Donkey Kong tries to purchase a Mini-Mario toy after seeing a commercial for the toys on television. However, all the stores are sold out. As a result, Donkey Kong travels to the company's factory and steals all of the Mini-Mario toys he can get his hands on. Eventually, Mario recovers all of the toys and defeats Donkey Kong. This is the first world in Mario vs. Donkey Kong.
The Mario Toy Company acts as the introductory world in the game and contains simple puzzles. The world has an urban setting, featuring the company's headquarters surrounded by its affiliated buildings and many apartment blocks. During the Donkey Kong fight, Mario must throw Garbage Cans that appear depending on the buttons that Donkey Kong activates for a total of four times.
In the sequel, Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Mini Peach, Mini Donkey Kong, and Mini Toad toys are also produced by the Mario Toy Company, here renamed the Mini Mario Toy Company. A theme park based on the toys is additionally made.

Exclusively in the Nintendo Switch version of Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a bonus level that appears after completing enough levels in this world or in Expert EX1. The layout strongly resembles the first area's layout shown in Level 1-5, except with the lack of enemies and Color Blocks. Three 1-Up Mushrooms are distributed in close proximity to the treasure box. To complete this level, the player must catch the flying key before time runs out.
