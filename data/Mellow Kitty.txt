Mellow Kitty is an enemy found in Wario: Master of Disguise. It is found in Carpaccio's Lab, and only one of them appears in the game. It appears to be a cat-like bubble with a teal design surrounding it. It attacks by consuming Wario. Any non-physical attack defeats it, and being tapped by the stylus several times after eating Wario works too. The name "Mellow Kitty" is a pun on Hello Kitty.
While inside a Mellow Kitty, Wario loses experience points for his currently-selected disguise, but he does not lose any health. He does not, however, drop a level. Therefore, once Wario has leveled all his disguises up to Level 3, this enemy is harmless.
Mellow Kitty, along with a randomly-spawning Treasure Pest, are the only enemies in Carpaccio's Lab that are not variants of Sir Lance-A-Lot.

This cat burglar has no interest in the true value of his loot. He just likes to stare at shiny things.
