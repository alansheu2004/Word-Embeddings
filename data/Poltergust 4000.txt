The Poltergust 4000 is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It resembles an upgraded model of the Poltergust 3000 from Luigi's Mansion. The emblem is located on both sides of the barrel.

The kart debuts in Mario Kart DS as Luigi's default signature kart, being unlocked for Yoshi and Waluigi as well when the player wins a gold trophy in all Nitro or Retro cups on 150cc. It becomes available for everyone else when a gold trophy is won in every cup on 150cc Mirror Mode.
The Poltergust 4000 has good speed, acceleration, and handling, and low weight, drift, and items. Its speed is tied with that of the Gold Mantis, and its weight is tied with the Mushmellow. The pre-release version of the Poltergust 4000 had Professor E. Gadd's emblem on it, implying that the kart is one of E. Gadd's inventions.

The Poltergust 4000 returns in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a Super kart. It uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and offers longer-lasting Slipstream boosts while awarding bonus points for performing Slipstreams. An icy-blue variant, named the Ice-blue Poltergust, was introduced in this game as a High-End kart.
