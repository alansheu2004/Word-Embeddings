Mushroom Kingdom U is a stage that appears in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It is based on several elements from New Super Mario Bros. U.
The match starts off on a stage based on Acorn Plains with Stretch Blocks. At certain points during a match, however, Kamek will appear and change the layout of the stage, in a manner similar to his role in the New Super Mario Bros. games. The stage variations that randomly appear after the initial layout are based on Rock-Candy Mines, Meringue Clouds, and the Tower levels (Slide Lift Tower in particular).
In the Rock-Candy Mines variation, characters fight on a wide Wobble Rock. In the Meringue Clouds variation, the match is set in an area similar to the Bouncy Cloud Boomerangs level. In the Tower variation, the stage takes place on a Slide Lift. Occasionally, in all stage layout variants, Water Geysers (sometimes with Big Urchins floating on top), falling icicles, and the beanstalk from the Skyward Stalk level spawning extra platforms may appear.
Nabbit occasionally appears in the stage, and he can stuff fighters into his bag and attempt to retreat to KO the player. Once captured, fighters can struggle to escape, but the higher percentage they have, the more difficult it is to escape. Fighters can also directly attack him and send him flying. Nabbit can be defeated as well, and he respawns after a set amount of time.
