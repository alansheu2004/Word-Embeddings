The Commoner Pass is a Useful Item in Paper Mario: The Origami King. Mario must purchase either this pass or the Royalty Pass from the vending machine at the start of Shogun Studios to enter the theme park. The Commoner Pass costs 2,400 coins, while the Royalty Pass costs 9,800. However, there are several differences and benefits to purchasing the Royalty Pass. Mainly, a Commoner Pass can only be used to enter the theme park once and disappears once Mario exits the park, while the Royalty Pass has unlimited uses. For this reason, Mario can only purchase one Royalty Pass, which remains in his inventory for the rest of the game, whereas he may be required to purchase multiple Commoner Passes. Due to this, Olivia recommends buying the Royalty Pass.
As certain treasures in the park are in chests that cannot be collected with a Commoner Pass, it is impossible to 100% complete this area without buying the Royalty Pass. Additionally, certain minigames such as fishing and Shuriken Dojo must be paid for each round if Mario is in possession of the Commoner Pass, whereas a Royalty Pass allows for free, infinite play.
