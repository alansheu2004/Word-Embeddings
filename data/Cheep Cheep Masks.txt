The Cheep Cheep Masks are a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. They first appeared in the Summer Festival Tour and became the signature glider of Cat Toad in the 2021 Cat Tour and Mario (Happi) in the Mario vs. Peach Tour. As its name implies, the glider consists of three masks that resemble a Cheep Cheep, an Eep Cheep, and a Deep Cheep, as well as the ones used as a hairband for Daisy (Yukata). Hitting opponents using a Blooper awards more points when using this glider. A similar glider known as the Boo Masks later debuted in the 2022 Mario vs. Luigi Tour.

Since introduced in the Summer Festival Tour, the Cheep Cheep Masks have appeared in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. At a later date, it has also become a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's availability by tour.
