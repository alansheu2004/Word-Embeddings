The GLA (Geländewagen A-Class) is a luxury compact SUV manufactured by Mercedes-Benz which appears as a kart body in Mario Kart 8, available exclusively in the Mercedes-Benz × Mario Kart 8 downloadable content pack. The vehicle has nine different color schemes, with the one it uses depending on what driver uses it; it is thus one of the two DLC vehicles to change colors in this way, the other being the City Tripper. The kart features a license plate on the back that reads "GLA"; these letters light up when the car enters anti-gravity mode. The GLA and the Gold Standard are the only vehicle bodies in Mario Kart 8 that do not feature the driver's emblem on them.
The GLA offers higher weight and traction, but lower acceleration, handling, and mini-turbo; it shares its stats with the Badwagon, Standard ATV, Tri-Speeder, and Steel Driver.
The GLA returns in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, in which it is no longer exclusive to DLC and can instead be unlocked randomly by collecting coins. Its stats are also slightly altered in accordance with the changes made to the other vehicles in the game. 
Mario driving the GLA appears as one of the many Costume Mario power-ups in Super Mario Maker. It is unlocked when the Mercedes-Benz Jump'n'Drive event course is completed.
In promotion of their content, Mercedes-Benz produced several commercials with Mario Kart 8 and Super Mario Maker for the GLA.
