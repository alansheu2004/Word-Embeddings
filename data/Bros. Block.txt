A Bros. Block is a special block found in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. It is a yellow block with an arrow on it. When struck by either Mario or Luigi, it moves in the direction of the arrow and changes to the opposite brother's color and initial. When struck by that brother, it moves back to where it was and changes again. Each time a Bros. Block is struck, the brothers receive a coin. Striking Bros. Blocks takes speedy timing, as there are usually 20 coins in each one. However, if the brothers are too slow on their jumping, fewer coins will be earned. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, they do not add to the game's total block counter.
