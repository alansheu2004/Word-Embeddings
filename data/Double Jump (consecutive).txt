The Double Jump (alternatively stylized as double jump), also called the Continuous Jump, is a move introduced in Super Mario 64. It is usable by every player character in the Super Mario series ever since its debut, except for Super Mario 3D Land, Super Mario 3D World, Super Mario Run, Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury, and Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The purpose of the Double Jump is for the player character to gain a higher altitude. The player can have their character perform a Double Jump by pressing the jump button just after landing from a prior jump. The resulting Double Jump moves the character slightly higher than a standard jump. After the player character lands from a Double Jump, quickly pressing the jump button for a third time executes a Triple Jump. Double Jumps are one of the few jumps that a player character can use while standing still. However, in New Super Mario Bros. and its sequels, the player character has to be running at full speed in order to double-jump.
