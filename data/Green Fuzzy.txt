The Green Fuzzy, formerly known as the Forest Fuzzy, is a variant of Fuzzy appearing in the first two games of the Paper Mario series. Like regular Fuzzies in these games, they are capable of draining hit points. The main difference with these Fuzzies is that they can duplicate themselves, with the new Fuzzy having the same amount of hit points as the original at the time of splitting. Also, they cannot duplicate if the maximum number of enemies are already in the battle.

In Paper Mario, Forest Fuzzies appear in Forever Forest from its second area onward. They have twice as many hit points as normal Fuzzies, but the same attack power. They are highly susceptible to all status effects and other special moves.

In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door along with its Nintendo Switch remake, Green Fuzzies are slightly more powerful than their normal counterpart, dealing 3 hit points of damage instead of 1 hit point of damage that regular Fuzzies deal. The first Green Fuzzy encountered is fought in the Glitz Pit, where it is a member of The Fuzz. Later, they appear in Keelhaul Key alongside the pink-colored Flower Fuzzy.
