The Glitter Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It first appeared in the London Tour and is the signature glider of Daisy (Holiday Cheer). The glider is a red, green and gold Christmas-themed bow with white ruffles and adorned with glitter. The glider increases the chances of getting Lightning from Item Boxes and the number of points earned for hitting drivers with Lightning. 
The Glitter Glider has four other variants: a brown plaid variant introduced in the Baby Rosalina Tour called the Plaid Ribbon, an orange variant based on Daisy (Yukata)'s outfit introduced in the Mario vs. Peach Tour called the Yukata Ribbon, a blue and purple variant based on Rosalina (Aurora)'s dress called the Galaxy Glider that was introduced in the 2021 Space Tour, and a blue, pink, and green Easter-themed variant called the Bright Ribbon that was introduced in the 2023 Yoshi Tour. The Plaid Ribbon is a Super glider, while the other three are High-End gliders.
