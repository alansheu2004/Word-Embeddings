The Cheep Snorkel is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Marine Tour and is the signature kart of Mario (Swimwear). The kart is based on the Cheep Charger, sporting scuba-diving equipment such as goggles, a snorkel, and an air tank featuring the driver's emblem on both sides, as well as gill-like vents on the sides. It uses a smaller version of the Metal tires. The Cheep Snorkel increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the amount of points earned for performing Jump Boosts.
A golden variant of this vehicle named the Gold Cheep Snorkel, also classified as a High-End kart, appears in the game.
