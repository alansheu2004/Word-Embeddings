The Bowser Mansion is a location in Mario Party Advance. It is found in the town area of Shroom City. It can only be accessed through the Pipe House. It is an elaborate home for Bowser and his lackey, Koopa Kid. It is decorated with giant, red flags on the wall with Bowser's logo, an enormous grandfather clock with a spiky stone motif, and a purple throne with a red cushion for Bowser to sit on. According to Bowser, the clock was a gift from his grandfather. One of Bowser's quests, Bowser: Accused!, takes place here, which involves Shroomlock accusing Bowser of stealing a painting from the local museum and asking the player to prove Bowser's guilt. Bowser claims that he stayed in the mansion on the day that the painting was stolen, with Koopa Kid corroborating his alibi. He also claims that he has never seen the painting before, but also that it is too big to hide in the mansion, therefore showing that he stole the painting. Bowser admits that he hid the painting outside the mansion, and sends Koopa Kid to fetch it with Shroomlock. He then challenges the player to a minigame, Mush Rush, and eventually rewards them with the Lip Sync Gaddget once they win the minigame.
