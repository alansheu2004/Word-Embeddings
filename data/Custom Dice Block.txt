The Custom Dice Block (known as the Lucky Number Dice Block in the British English version of Mario Party: Island Tour) is a usable item that appears throughout the Mario Party series.

The item first appears in Mario Party: Island Tour. It can be obtained only on the Perilous Palace Path board by either winning a minigame activated by a Free-for-All Space or landing on an Item Space. It acts just like a Dice Block, except the player can choose how many spaces to move before rolling. If the dice is rolled by itself, the numbers 1 through 6 can be chosen. If the dice is rolled along with the Bronze, Silver, or Gold Dice Block, the total number will be added together (2-8, 2-9, or 2-12, respectively). If the player was hit with a Blooper Chopper  or a Lightning Score Striker, the total is reduced to a lower number after rolling the Dice Block.

The Custom Dice Block reappears in Super Mario Party, where it only appears in the main Mario Party mode. When used, it allows players to choose a number of spaces from 1 to 6. If the player has any allies, it also stops them from rolling their additional 1-2 dice. It can be obtained from an Item Space, and it can be purchased in one of Flutter's shops on every board except for Kamek's Tantalizing Tower, where it can be purchased for 6 coins at the Shady Shop. Its overall appearance is now similar to the Slow Dice Block.

The Custom Dice Block also returns in Mario Party Superstars as an item, though this time the numbers 1 to 10 can be chosen due to the regular Dice Block also being numbered 1 to 10. It can be obtained from Item Spaces and Lucky Spaces, and it can be purchased on every board at some point.

The Custom Dice Block returns in Super Mario Party Jamboree, functioning similarly to its rendition in Mario Party Superstars. 

The following is a price list showing how much the Custom Dice costs within the Item Shop in each game.
