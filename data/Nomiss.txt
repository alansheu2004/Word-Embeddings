Nomiss was an online Nintendo-published Adobe Shockwave game made to promote the release of Mario Party 2 on the Nintendo 64. It was playable from the official Mario Party 2 website. The game shows what looks to be a flying saucer with 5 circles on top, reminiscent of the style of the Space Land board from Mario Party 2. The circles are colored orange, green, blue, yellow, and pink. These circles also have portraits of Donkey Kong, Luigi, Toad, a Star, and Princess Peach on their respectively-colored circles, and the Nintendo logo in the center.

The game is a simple memory rhythm game, similar to Simon. It lights up one of the character circles at a time with an accompanying sound effect in a certain pattern, which the player has to memorize and repeat. The game starts with a one circle pattern, and adds more circles onto it until the pattern is 5 clicks long. The player is then rewarded with a Mushroom. Should the player decide to play again, the game provides them with a harder version that has a pattern that can grow to 10 clicks long. When the player finishes this, they are rewarded with a Golden Mushroom.
