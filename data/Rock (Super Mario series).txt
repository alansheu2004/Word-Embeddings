Rocks are somewhat recurring objects in the 3D Super Mario games. A Rock has an item of interest inside. Making contact or attacking one makes it roll and eventually break. Its geometric shape prevents it from rolling very far. In most situations, Rocks fall apart after one hit and contain a coin. In Super Mario 3D Land, kicking a Rock into a pipe causes a 1-Up Mushroom to pop out. In Super Mario Odyssey, some Rocks contain multiple coins or Power Moons and require several hits before breaking.
Super Mario 3D World is the only 3D Super Mario title released since 2010 not to feature Rocks.
