The Camo Tanooki Kart is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Animal Tour and is the signature kart of Kitsune Luigi. As the name indicates, the kart is a camouflage-patterned variant of the Tanooki Kart with a red handlebar. Unlike the Tanooki Kart, it uses the Tropical Truck's tires. Also unlike the Tanooki Kart, this kart increases the duration of Mini-Turbo boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Mini-Turbo.

The Camo Tanooki Kart is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it is not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the kart's availability by tour.
