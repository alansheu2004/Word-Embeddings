The Smelter is a member of the Smithy Gang and is the source of Smithy's minions during the events of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. The Smelter produces the hot liquid metal used by Smithy to form his robotic armies. Using his sledgehammer, Smithy pounds the metal into various monstrosities (including the recent Jabits and the Machine Made), which are then sent to the assembly lines before being ordered to attack Mushroom Kingdom.
During Mario's final battle with Smithy, the Smelter produces an unending supply of Shypers, the most powerful version of the Shymore. These Shypers wield some of the strongest attacks in the game. After it has received enough damage, it will stop producing the liquid metal. It is last seen being alarmed that the floor was crumbling, concerned for its master.
Defeating the Smelter is optional; depleting Smithy's HP is all that's required to advance the battle to its second phase.
