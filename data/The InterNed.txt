The InterNed is a character in Super Paper Mario. He is a digital block with a bowtie, a hat, and a face made with pixels. His name is a portmanteau of "Internet" and the name "Ned." He was created by the inventor The InterChet. The InterNed appears in Merlee's Mansion as a quiz host who helps Mario and Peach find out which Merlee is genuine after Mimi makes herself look identical to her on the "That's My Merlee!" show.
The InterNed also appears in the The Underwhere bar in Flipside after the game is beaten. The InterNed can here be used as a sound test. For ten Coins, The InterNed plays a song from the game on the jukebox in the bar, though the song picked is entirely random. However, the song can have the possibility of being picked only if it is already heard. For example, if the player did not play Tilt Island in the Flipside Arcade yet, The InterNed cannot play Tilt Island's background music on the jukebox. His Catch Card is found on Flipside B1 by flipping near the top of the water.
