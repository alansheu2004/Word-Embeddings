Big Blasters, originally known as Big Berthas, are the stronger form of Blasters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. The enemy's original name is derived from the giant war cannon made during World War I. This cannon fires more powerful Bullet Bills than a normal Blaster and is found in Bowser's Keep. The cannon can also use the special move Blazer, which can instantly defeat one ally. However, since Big Blasters have such high defense but low magic defense, they can be beaten easily by most magic spells, especially lightning. Its original thought is a pun on the phrase "Bada bing, bada boom." Unlike most stronger enemy variants in the game, it is colored exactly the same as its weaker counterpart; the only other example is Lava Babble.
