A Little Skull Mouser, also known as a Little Skull Monster, is an enemy appearing only in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, and Yoshi's New Island It is a variant of Little Mouser that jumps aimlessly and, like most enemies, can knock Baby Mario off of a Yoshi's back. Little Skull Mousers cannot steal eggs, unlike Little Mousers. When a Yoshi jumps on a Little Skull Mouser's head, hits it with an egg, or spits an enemy at it, the skull it is wearing crumbles, turning the creature into a normal Little Mouser. Unlike many other small enemies, a Little Skull Mouser cannot be defeated immediately by a Ground Pound; instead, the attack has the same effect on it as a normal jump, merely destroying the skull on its head.
In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Little Skull Mousers are first encountered in The Baseball Boys. Yoshi's New Island, Little Skull Mousers appear in Bandit Valley.
