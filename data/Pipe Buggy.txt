The Pipe Buggy is a Normal kart in Mario Kart Tour. It is a dune buggy that looks similar to the Mario Kart 64, Mario Kart: Super Circuit, and Mario Kart 7 versions of the Pipe Frame. It has a dark indigo color, similar to Waluigi's Pipe Frame. The emblem is located on the front of the kart. It uses blue versions of the Monster tires. The Pipe Buggy increases the duration of Slipstream boosts and the points earned for performing Slipstreams. A variant known as the Rainbow Pipe Buggy appears in the game starting with the 2023 Mario Tour.

The Pipe Buggy is available in regular tour pipes and is also part of the shop's Daily Selects lineup. The table below lists the special availability of the kart by tour.
