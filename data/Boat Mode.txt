Boat Mode is an origami-like transformation in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. It allows Mario and his partners to traverse across water unscathed, similar to Sushie's overworld ability in Paper Mario; waves will push the boat back, however. Like his other origami-themed forms, the boat form is granted to him in the form of a "curse" from one of the black chest demons, this one in Pirate's Grotto, where it is primarily used. Additionally, there is a minigame in the Pianta Parlor based around this mode.
It is similar to Mario's Plane Mode in that it can only be activated when Mario is on the form's corresponding panel, known as a boat panel. It differs in that Mario is required to touch another boat panel in order to return to normal.
In the remake, if Mario wears the Gold Medal, the white paper usually surrounding him during Boat Mode's transformation becomes gold.
