Frenzy mode (known in the "Tips & Tricks" as an item frenzy) is a state in Mario Kart Tour that the player enters when they have three of the same item, either from a single Item Box or different ones. For the duration of a Frenzy, which totals nine seconds, the player is invincible and can use an indefinite amount of the acquired item, gaining points for each use. The kart is surrounded by copies of the item (six units for most), which vanish when the Frenzy ends. The player can also perform Ultra Mini-Turbos much faster in this state, though all Mini-Turbos do not provide points during a Frenzy. The higher the driver's level and rarity is, the higher their chance of getting an Item Frenzy. Both human and computer players can get a Frenzy, though only one racer can enter it at a time, and their icon will turn gold on the map for its duration. Players can get a maximum of three Frenzies each race, with the second lap providing a higher chance of getting them.

Timed items, such as Bullet Bills, are activated as soon as the Frenzy starts and only give extra points when reactivated during it. A Frenzy that leaves items on the track is limited to six at a time; once the player surpasses this limit, the oldest one will vanish. A Frenzy that releases multiple items at once count each item individually towards the limit, but one that produces items as an effect on hit, such as Yoshi's Egg, will not have these secondary items count towards the limit. Certain Tour Challenges require the player to start a Frenzy.
