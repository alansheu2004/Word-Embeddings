The "25m Theme", also known as "25m BGM", is a simple, five-note musical theme composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the arcade version of Donkey Kong. The theme is derived from the bassline to "The Ballad of John and Yoko", a 1969 song by English rock band the Beatles. It can only be heard in the 25m level in the original arcade version, but it is sometimes used in other levels in later ports of Donkey Kong.

The following list does not include ports or remakes of Donkey Kong.
