Gringills are huge orange eels with large eyes and teeth found in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. There are two variants of Gringills: ones that lurk in caves and stretch out to snap their jaws at anyone who approaches, and ones that freely swim around in loops. They attack simply by trying to bite Mario or Luigi. Gringills can be defeated by throwing a Koopa Shell at them while they are underwater.
In Super Mario Galaxy, cave-based Gringills appear in the Beach Bowl Galaxy and the Sea Slide Galaxy, while swimming ones appear in the Drip Drop Galaxy, the Bigmouth Galaxy, and the Deep Dark Galaxy. In Super Mario Galaxy 2, only the cave-based ones appear, being in the Cosmic Cove Galaxy and the Slimy Spring Galaxy.
