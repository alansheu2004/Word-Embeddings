Pink Coins are a type of coin that appear in Super Mario Maker and Super Mario Maker 2. They were first introduced in Super Mario Maker through a software update released on March 9, 2016. These coins have a key icon imprint on them like Key Coins from Super Mario 3D World, which work in a very similar way.

Pink Coins are similar in appearance and function to Red Coins, and share a similar sound effect when obtained. During level editing, they can be produced by shaking a coin in the original game, and by tapping the coin to open a menu in the sequel. If Mario collects all the Pink Coins in a level, a key will appear, which can be used to unlock a locked door. A maximum of five Pink Coins can be placed in the main level, in addition to another maximum of five in the sub-level, for a maximum of ten in the entire level. All Pink Coins are part of the same collection and all go towards one key, even if two sets of coins are put into both the main and sub-level.
