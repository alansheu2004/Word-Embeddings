Rock Candy is a damage-dealing item in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. When used, the Rock Candy performs a shining star storm, visually similar to Meteor Blast, hitting all enemies for 200 points of damage. If the user has the "Attack Up" effect such as from Geno Boost or the Quartz Charm, the damage output is raised to 300. This item can be found in certain dungeons as inside the Pipes of Bean Valley or inside Bowser's Keep. They can also be won from Mushroom Boy or by defeating Jawfuls, Grand Troopas, Puppoxes and Machine Made Speardovichs (only in the original game). In the remake, the Star Gust item from the Toad Assist Gauge Move functions like Rock Candy, inflicting non-fixed damage to all enemies.
