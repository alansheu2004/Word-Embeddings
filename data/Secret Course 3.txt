Secret Course 3 is the secret level of the Macro Zone in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. It is unlocked by finding the secret exit in The Ant Monsters. Beating the level unlocks a shortcut to Final Boss: One Mighty Mouse!. It is the only secret level in the game to lead to a different level.

The level is an autoscrolling level that starts on several Empty Blocks. After that platform there is a gap in between a set of two Empty Blocks followed by another set of two Empty Blocks and a set of three Empty Blocks with a ? Block containing either a Fire Flower or a Mushroom above the last Empty Block. After the three Empty Blocks there is a set of four Empty Blocks, a Flimsy Lift, three Empty Blocks, two Flimsy Lifts, four Empty Blocks, and eight bricks that lead to a staircase of Empty Blocks. On the top of the staircase there is a row of horizontal Empty Blocks with a one-block gap that is in between a staircase of Empty Blocks leading downwards. Before the row of horizontal Empty Blocks there is a row of bricks that lead to a small room with a large amount of coins when the bricks are broken with a Spin Jump. Above this room the downwards staircase leads to a line of Empty Blocks followed by an upwards staircase of Empty Blocks that leads to a line of Empty Blocks with a brick. There is a set of five Empty Blocks with a ? Block containing a Fire Flower above the middle Empty Block. There is a set of four Empty Blocks that leads to a large platform of Empty Blocks. In the platform there are two fiery blocks that lead to a room with a ? Block that contains a 1-Up Heart and several more of the blocks. Above this room is a line of Empty Blocks. After the platform there is a fiery block in midair. After that block the autoscrolling stops and a wooden platform with the Goal door appears.
