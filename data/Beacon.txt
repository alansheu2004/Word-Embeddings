The beacon is a large star-like reactor that powers the Comet Observatory, including the space station's propulsion systems, its life support, and its domes, introduced in Super Mario Galaxy. The beacon begins as a small dim star, but as Mario collects more Grand Stars, the star becomes larger and brighter, allowing access to more domes. The Lumas need the beacon to survive. Through the course of the game, it changes colors from burgundy (no Grand Stars) to orange (one Grand Star), then yellow (two Grand Stars), green (three Grand Stars), sea green (four Grand Stars), blue (five Grand Stars), and finally turquoise (six Grand Stars). There is also an invisible wall that prevents the player from touching the beacon.
In Super Mario Galaxy 2, Starship Mario has, in its engine room, what appears to be a miniature beacon that runs on Power Stars. This miniature beacon is the energy source for the starship. It is additionally colored only turquoise for the entire game.
In Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, while the Comet Observatory is under Cursa's control as part of its stronghold, the beacon becomes the source of all Darkmess spreading across the galaxy, and also serves as the entrance to the core of the Darkmess Dimension where Cursa resides.
