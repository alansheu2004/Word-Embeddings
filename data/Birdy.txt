Birdys are creatures wearing a red bird costume that serve as bodyguards to Valentina in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. However, they seem to have a hatred for her, perhaps due to her working them too hard. These creatures appear on the way to Nimbus Land, and inside the palace at Nimbus Land. 
They also have relatives called Bluebirds who have better magic stats, but lower physical stats as well as reversed strength and weaknesses.
In battle, they are adept at using Grinder as an offensive attack and have a high attack stat. They resist fire and sleep attacks, but are weak against ice attacks. If Mallow uses the special attack Thunderbolt, there is a chance they will be stunned. While stunned, they will end up being confused and attack itself or its own allies.
