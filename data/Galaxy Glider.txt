The Galaxy Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It debuted in the 2021 Space Tour, and is a space-themed Plaid Ribbon, which itself is a variant of the Glitter Glider, with pictures of stars and Saturn, similar to the Planet Glider. It later became the signature glider of Baby Mario (Koala) in the 2022 Cat Tour. The color scheme itself is similar to the Luma Parafoil, as well as Rosalina (Aurora)'s dress. Unlike the Plaid Ribbon and the Glitter Glider, hitting racers while under the effects of a Mega Mushroom grants more points when using this glider.
