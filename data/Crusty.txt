Crusty is a powerful crab-like enemy that lives in the waters in and around Johnny's Sunken Ship in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. A Crusty actually has a pink exoskeleton; however, since they are usually found underwater, they appear blue. Their real coloration can be seen if the Blooper Nanny is lured to the edge. In the Nintendo Switch remake, its pink coloration is seen underwater.
Crusties are very powerful monsters but are also very rare; they can only be found aiding other types of underwater monsters in battle. These crustaceans have high physical attack and high physical defense. A Crusty uses its massive pincers to inflict severe damage to an opponent 2/3 of the time, or fires a light bubble 1/3 of the time that does no damage, but with the effect of inflicting Mute. Crusties do not have any magic.
Although Crusties have high physical defense, their magical defense is low, and they are weak to Fire and Thunder. As such, Mario and Mallow can defeat them fairly easily. Crusties are related to the more powerful Star Crusters.
