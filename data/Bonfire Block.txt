Bonfire Blocks (also known as Flame Blocks or Fire Blocks) are blocks that appearing in Virtual Boy Wario Land and all following installments of the Wario Land series. They appear as blocks with a picture of a flame on them. In Wario Land II, they have a basic appearance, and in Wario Land 3, they are purple blocks, while in Virtual Boy Wario Land and Wario Land 4 they are made to resemble cubic stones. In Wario Land: Shake It!, they have a palette similar to the Game Boy Color version of Wario Land II except with the addition of a yellow, metallic-looking border. Bonfire Blocks are completely impenetrable and, in most of the games, they can only be destroyed by having Wario turn into Flaming Wario and touch the block. In Virtual Boy Wario Land, they can be broken only by the flaming power of either Sea Dragon or King Dragon Wario. Unlike the fiery blocks of Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, the flames keep going through the destroyed block. Bonfire Blocks are usually placed in strategic places and often hide treasure and coins; they can also cover Warp Pipes.
In Wario Land 3, Bonfire Blocks appear in Out of the Woods, Bank of the Wild River, The Tidal Coast, A Town in Chaos, The West Crater, Tower of Revival, Cave of Flames, The Colossal Hole, and The East Crater.
A counterpart for Snowman Wario of the Bonfire Block exists in the form of the Snowman Block.
