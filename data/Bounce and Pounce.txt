Bounce and Pounce is one of Mario's minigames in Super Mario 64 DS. It features Mario, who has apparently split into three bodies, falling through the air while attempting to stomp on Fly Guys.

The objective of the minigame is to have the three Marios stomp on all the Fly Guys, thus clearing the level. The player can control the Marios by tapping them with the stylus. When tapped in the middle, the Mario is shot directly upwards; when tapped on the left, he is shot upwards to the right; and when tapped on the right, he is shot upwards to the left. If one of the Marios falls off the Touch Screen, one of the three lives is lost; however, the Mario reappears. For every five levels completed, the player's lives are restored to three. The minigame ends when the player loses all their lives.

Out of all the patterns featured on the first fifteen levels, the one on Level 14 is the only one not to occur afterwards.

Mario's in free fall, but he can bounce back if you touch him. Stomp the Fly Guys, but make sure he doesn't fall off the Touch Screen.
