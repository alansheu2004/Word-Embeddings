Toadofsky is a character in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. He is a Mushroom composer whose name is a play on the name of Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, although his hair looks more like that of Johann Sebastian Bach. He is found in Melody Bay, a small area connected to Tadpole Pond, where he is struggling to compose a new song due to composer's block. Mario can help him by playing three specific melodies, and after each one, Toadofsky gives Mario a special membership card that unlocks items at the Tadpole Pond's Juice Bar. After all three melodies are played, Toadofsky allows Mario to compose the last quarter of the symphony himself. During the ending, Toadofsky is seen putting on a concert attended by the Frog Sage. 
Toadofsky, referred to as Toadofski, also appears in Mario and the Incredible Rescue. He gives Mario, Luigi, and Toad one of the six Mushrooms in exchange for Mario composing a new song. Mario titled his new composition "Falling Down a Waterfall."
The following are the melodies of Toadofsky's symphony:
