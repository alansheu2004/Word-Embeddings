World 1-1 is the first course of World 1, and subsequently, of Super Mario 3D Land. It is a simple outside course that introduces the players to the Super Leaf. Peach's Castle and the Tail Tree can be seen in the background at the beginning of the level.  The level's icon is a grassy area with a leaping Cheep Cheep, a Goomba, and a tiered grassy cliff. This is one of the few levels to not have a remake in the Special Worlds.

When Mario starts, he crosses a small bridge with a leaping Cheep Cheep to an area with two Brick Blocks along with a ? Block that has a Super Leaf inside. He then crosses another stream. Soon after, an area with Brick Blocks and bushes in the ground are found. If Mario goes off the nearby fence there is a crate blocking a tunnel with a 1-Up Mushroom in it. Also, on the blocks that hold the tunnel there is a bird that flies away when Mario approaches it, revealing a 1-Up Mushroom. Close to this area is a small wall and two lifts to help Mario get to the top. Above the cliff, there are many dandelions, some trees, and two Goombas. Notice that the player can blow into the microphone or manually destroy the dandelions, which can sometimes expose coins. Ahead is a castle-like wall and many Brick Blocks. In one of them is hidden a gear that makes the ground under it rise when Mario spins it by swinging the Tanooki-tail of his Tanooki Suit. Above is a small roof with crates. After Mario exits this area, he can use a pair of binoculars to see Toad attempting to teach how to jump on the Goal Pole. Mario can head forward to some Tail Goombas, Brick Blocks, and Note Blocks. Some land platforms and wooden bridges are found in an narrow path, leading to more Tail Goombas and a Big Tail Goomba. A small island is in the middle of pond up ahead, with colored blocks and the Goal Pole.
