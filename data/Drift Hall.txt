The Drift Hall (Drift Passage in the British English version) is a room inside of the Secret Mine in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. It is accessed by taking the south door inside of the Prospector's Crossing or by taking the south door inside of the Basin. It is a long hallway with half of it covered in snow and the other half in ice. Several beams of wood are still intact and a large chunk of ice with dynamite sticking out from it can be found in the left side. The door on the northeast wall leads into the Prospector's Crossing and the door on the northwest leads to the Basin.
During Cold Case, Luigi needs to go to the Drift Hall in order to reach the alternate entrance to the Airway. However, the door to the Basin is locked. He must make his way to the hallway's right side to locate a Treasure Chest with a key. Some bats may attack him on the way. On the far left side, there is a fuse connected to a pair of dynamite bundles encased in ice. If Luigi lights this fuse with the nearby torch, he can access a bonus challenge inside of a large diving helmet-shaped object. In this Mini Dimension, he must complete the face of a snowman using pieces of coal. If he accomplishes this task, sixty bills rain down from the sky. During Severe Infestation, the Drift Hall might be one of the rooms infested with ghosts.
