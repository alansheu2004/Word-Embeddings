A Simu-Block (alternatively Simu-block) is a block found in the Mario & Luigi series. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake, this half-red, half-green variety of ! Block always comes in pairs and must be struck simultaneously by Mario and Luigi to be activated. These blocks are usually separated by some distance and require some puzzle-solving to be able to hit them both at the same time.
In Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, these blocks are called Simultaneous Blocks and are in a quad-color scheme. They appear in either pairs or sets of four, but they are always next to each other. Only one of the blocks is solid at first; any others are holograms. The Mario Bros., their baby selves, or all four must strike them, one after another, to activate their effect.
