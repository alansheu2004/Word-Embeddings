Jumbo Rays are enemies debuting in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. They are Mantas that are green and wear a pair of swim goggles. Jumbo Rays can leap and fly through the sky, allowing the player characters to stand on them as platforms until they disappear into the fog. Their appearance and manner are similar to those of Dolphins. Despite being Mantas, they lack the usual pair of cephalic fins around their mouths, and instead resemble eagle rays with their slightly elongated snouts.

Jumbo Rays are enemies in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. They are encountered in World 5-5 only. The player characters have to use the Jumbo Rays to traverse the level. Jumbo Rays make a whistling noise when the player jumps on them, similarly to if the player jumps on a Para-Beetle. However, the Jumbo Rays' sound does not go up the music scale as the Para-Beetle does. Jumbo Rays are not enemies and cannot hurt Mario.

One Jumbo Ray appears near the start of the underwater zone of Tropical Coast in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, and unlike other appearances, it does not fly in the air.

Jumbo Rays have appeared as background characters in the Mario Party series. In Mario Party: Island Tour, a large group of Jumbo Rays can be seen in the background of the Hot-Air Hijinks minigame mode, a Jumbo Ray can be seen in the background of one of the scenes depicted in the minigame Get Reel, and a Jumbo Ray can be seen at the hot-air balloon in the minigame Point 'n' Shoot. In Mario Party 10, Jumbo Rays appear in the backgrounds of the minigames Bouncy Brawl and Bubble Squabble.

Jumbo Rays fly around in the background of the Sky Island course in Mario Golf: World Tour.
