The Cape Mario Hanafuda is a glider that appears in Mario Kart Tour. It is a variant of the Baby Mario Hanafuda with a hanafuda-style drawing of Cape Mario surrounded by flowers and is classified as a tour-exclusive High-End glider. The glider can be unlocked in the Peach Tour, where it appears in a Tour Gift for Gold Pass members. Unlike the Baby Mario Hanafuda, using Mega Mushrooms grants more points when using this glider. Like the Baby Mario Hanafuda, the Yoshi's Egg Hanafuda, the Peach Hanafuda, the Barrel Hanafuda, and the Blooper Hanafuda, the artwork on the glider is taken from Mario Hanafuda, and the glider itself was added in the month it was used for in the set, June.
It is one of eleven variants of the Baby Mario Hanafuda, with the others being the Yoshi's Egg Hanafuda, Peach Hanafuda, Barrel Hanafuda, Blooper Hanafuda, Bullet Bill Hanafuda, Boo Hanafuda, Piranha Plant Hanafuda, Goomba Hanafuda, Jumping Mario Hanafuda, and Bowser Hanafuda. They are all classified as High-End gliders and were available exclusively through the Gold Pass in their debut tour until later reappearing in the Hanafuda Pipe, the special pipe of the Trick Tour (2021).
