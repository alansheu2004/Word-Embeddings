Quiz Host is a red Spark in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, exclusively in the Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC. It is the host of the "Who's a Bright Spark?!" quiz show, and has the Quiz Show!!! Spark Quest.
Quiz Host asks the heroes eight random questions about Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, although only six must be answered correctly to win, with up to three incorrect answers allowed. After the Quiz Show, the Spark becomes surprised to find a Darkmess Puddle in place of the actual reward: an all-expenses paid vacation to Palette Prime. After the heroes cleanse the Darkmess Puddle, they can talk with the Quiz Host to participate in the lightning round, which shares the exact same rules with the normal trivia round. Completion of the lightning round awards the heroes with a treasure chest containing coins.
Quiz Host, along with Movie Director are the only Sparks in the game to not join the heroes in any way. Instead, a Gold Prism is awarded to the heroes for completing the Quest.
