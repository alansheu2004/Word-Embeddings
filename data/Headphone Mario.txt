Headphone Mario is a form Mario can use in Super Mario Run. The headphones Mario wears feature Mario's emblem on the ends, and the accent color on them is the same as the one used for Goal Poles and Checkpoint Flags he uses. Headphone Mario represents the ability to listen to music from apps other than Super Mario Run. This feature, and by proxy Headphone Mario, was introduced in the version version 3.0.4 update.
To toggle the game's music, the player can tap an option in the Area map for Remix 10, in the pause menu of Remix 10, or above the Toad wearing headphones in the kingdom after he is tapped. All of these options only appear after the player completes their first round of Remix 10.
As a form representing a game mechanic, Headphone Mario can be used with any other power-up, and is not lost by taking damage or being defeated. Equally so, it does not protect Mario from damage. Headphone Mario is also visible in Mario's icon on the Remix 10 map, immediately changing form with the menu's use. The headphones produce music note effects at all times.
Every character can wear headphones through the same means as Mario. Toad and Toadette's headphone's accent colors have differing shades compared to the character's design, their Goal Poles, and their Checkpoint Flags.
