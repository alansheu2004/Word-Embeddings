The Green Kiddie Kart is a Normal kart in Mario Kart Tour, introduced in the Valentine's Tour. It is a green and dark blue variant of the Red Kiddie Kart that resembles the front of Luigi's overalls. Like the Red Kiddie Kart, it uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Unlike the Red Kiddie Kart, this kart increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Rocket Start.
Despite being a variant of the Red Kiddie Kart, it was introduced two tours before the original's debut in the Mario Bros. Tour.

Since its introduction in the Valentine's Tour, the Green Kiddie Kart has appeared in the First Pipe and Second Pipe of each tour and is currently a part of the Daily Selects set. It has also been made available through other means, shown below.

Prior to the game's version 2.0.1 update, the Green Kiddie Kart had a few favored and favorite courses that were available before its official debut in the Valentine's Tour: Tokyo Blur 2R and 3DS Toad Circuit R/T (which had not been used since the 2020 New Year's Tour), and both London Loop R and London Loop R/T (which had not been used since the London Tour). 3DS Toad Circuit R/T was eventually readded to the kart's favorite courses at the start of the 2020 Trick Tour, Tokyo Blur 2R was eventually readded to the kart's favored courses at the start of the Summer Festival Tour, and London Loop R and London Loop R/T were eventually readded to the kart's favored courses at the start of the 1st Anniversary Tour.
