The Wildfire Flyer is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the 2019 Winter Tour, it is the signature kart of Pink Gold Peach, Peach (Vacation) and Peach (Wintertime). The kart is a white and pinkish-magenta variant of the Flame Flyer, resembling a color-inverted version of the female Mii's variant in Mario Kart Wii, except with a darker pink for the flames, and lavender engine blower flaps. Unlike the Flame Flyer, it uses the Pipe Frame's tires. Also unlike the Flame Flyer, this kart increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the points earned for performing Jump Boosts.

Starting with the 2020 Exploration Tour, the Wildfire Flyer is available in all regular tour pipes. Starting with the Battle Tour, it is also available in the Daily Selects lineup. The table below shows this kart's special availabilities by tour.
