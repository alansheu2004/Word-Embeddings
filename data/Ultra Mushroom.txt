An Ultra Mushroom (also known as an Ultra Shroom or Max Mushroom) is a healing item found in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, the Mario & Luigi series, and the Paper Mario series.

In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Ultra Mushrooms are known as Max Mushrooms, have yellow caps, and completely refill one party member's HP when used.

In the Paper Mario series, these mushrooms, known as Ultra Shrooms, have the same green caps as 1-Up Mushrooms (which are absent in the first three Paper Mario games).
In the first Paper Mario, Ultra Shrooms are never sold by shops, but instead found rarely throughout the Mushroom Kingdom in Dry Dry Desert, Shiver City, Shiver Mountain, Bowser's Castle and outside of Peach's Castle. They are also left by gold Li'l Oinks in international versions of the game.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, very few places sell Ultra Mushroom (originally called Ultra Shrooms); however, they may be purchased for 200 Coins each at the Deepdown Depot, the shop in Rogueport Underground, and they can also be found in the Pianta Parlor for 67 (80 in the Nintendo Switch remake) pianta tokens. Charlieton occasionally sells Ultra Mushrooms for 120 coins.
In Super Paper Mario, Ultra Shrooms are found hidden within ? Blocks. Due to their high HP recovery, they are generally found before boss battles during the later chapters of the game. They heal 50 HP on contact with the player, and their carry-on equivalent is the Ultra Shroom Shake.

In the Mario & Luigi series, Ultra Mushrooms refill 120 HP in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, 80 HP in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, and 100 HP in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey.
