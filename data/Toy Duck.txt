A Toy Duck appears as a course element in the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart Tour course Squeaky Clean Sprint. It is a rubber duck wearing Mario's cap. Though it only fulfills an aesthetic purpose in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it plays a small gameplay role in Mario Kart Tour.

In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Toy Duck floats on the water in the course's bathtub, rotating slowly while standing in place.

The Toy Duck reappears in the same place in the Mario Kart Tour rendition of Squeaky Clean Sprint, though it does not rotate any more. Multiple identical Toy Ducks also lie throughout the course's T and R/T variants, including outside the bathtub, while being completely absent in the R variant. In this game, Toy Ducks rock slightly and give bonus points when hit with an offensive item, such as a Banana, a Green Shell, or a Bob-omb. They also physically react, but do not give points, when a Mushroom is shot out of a Mushroom Cannon into them.
