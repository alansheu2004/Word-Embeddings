NBA Street V3 is a basketball video game that had a multiplatform release for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2, though only the GameCube version features Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach as playable characters, collectively known in-game as the "Nintendo All-Stars". This is in response to a deal between EA and Nintendo in which EA would include Nintendo characters and properties in a few of their games; another game to take advantage of this was SSX on Tour. A basketball court based on the Super Mario franchise, named the Nintendo Court, is also featured in the GameCube version.  NBA Street V3 is the third game in EA's NBA Street series. It was developed by EA Canada, published by EA Sports Big, and certified by THX in 2005.

On top of the following playable characters, the game has a custom character creation mode. 

All teams represented are based on their entire 2004â€“05 NBA season roster, accurate as of December 20, 2004. 

These characters are original characters created for the game.

These characters are retired or deceased basketball players, as of the game's development.

All three characters are members of the hip-hop group Beastie Boys.
