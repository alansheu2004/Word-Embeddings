The Jade Hop Rod is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the 2021 Ninja Tour, it is the signature kart of Shy Guy (Ninja) and Mario (Happi). The kart is a green vehicle resembling a frog with red stripes, orange lips, a white underside, white and purple exhaust pipes, and two katanas on each side. It uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and the emblem appears at the front and back of the kart. Its name is a play on "hot rod" and "hop". The Jade Hop Rod increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the number of bonus points awarded for performing Jump Boosts.
Four variants of this kart also appear, being the Crimson Hop Rod, Dark Hop Rod, Sakura Hop Rod, and Gold Hop Rod. All of them are classified as High-End karts. 

The Jade Hop Rod is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and is not a part of the Daily Selects set. The table below shows the kart's availability in tours.
