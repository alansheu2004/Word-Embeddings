Stone circles are clusters of interactable objects in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. A stone circle consists of eight small rocks arranged into a ring on the ground. Spinning within the ring transforms each of the rocks into a collectible Star Bit. There are iterations of circles themed to the level's environment. In beach galaxies, such as the Beach Bowl Galaxy and Cosmic Cove Galaxy, the player can find shell circles (or shell rings). The cake-shaped planet at the end of Sweet Sweet Galaxy has a strawberry circle on its top. On an airship in Bowser Jr.'s Airship Armada, a circle is combined with a valve, where spinning it releases Star Bits from the eight vents surrounding it. Only the stone and shell circles appear in both Super Mario Galaxy games.
There are flowers in Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Odyssey that are similar in concept.
