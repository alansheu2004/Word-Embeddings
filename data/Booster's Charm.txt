Booster's Charm (originally known as the Amulet) is an accessory in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. It halves damage taken from elemental attacks, an effect shared with the Nurture Ring. Additionally, it increases both physical and magical attack and defense by seven, though it decreases speed by five. Booster's Charm is given by Booster as thanks for getting his Mario doll for him; for this event to happen, Mario first needs to successfully hide from the Snifsters behind the curtains in the room while they search for it. In the original SNES game, the player only has one opportunity to obtain this item, but in the remake for Nintendo Switch, it can alternatively be obtained by defeating Engine 023 Booster in the post-game if they had failed to obtain it from the curtain event. In the original game, it can be sold for 100 coins, but will be lost forever once it is sold, whereas in the remake, it cannot be sold at all.
