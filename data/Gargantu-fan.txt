Gargantu-fan is a Spark that appears in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, located in Barrendale Mesa, in the battle Magikoopa Mayhem. After the battle, Gargantu-fan joins the heroes on their adventure. Gargantu-fan is the last mandatory Spark to obtain in the story.
In battle, Gargantu-fan's ability is Kong Cameo, which temporarily summons Rabbid Kong, who causes a shockwave around the hero, dealing damage, damaging cover, and bouncing away all enemies within range. Formerly, enemies that were resistant to the Splash Super Effect will not be bounced away, but they still take the full damage. Now Splash-resistant enemies are bounced by the attack. Gargantu-fan can be upgraded by feeding it Star Bits, which will increase the damage done by the attack. Its passive ability is Healing Booster, which increases the maximum HP of the hero. When upgraded, the amount of extra HP increases even more.
Gargantu-fan is a somewhat tall, white Spark with a similar appearance to Screech, although Gargantu-fan wields a red flag, rather than a megaphone.
