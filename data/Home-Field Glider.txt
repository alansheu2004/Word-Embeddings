The Home-Field Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2021 Los Angeles Tour, and is the signature glider of Mario (Baseball) and Chargin' Chuck. It is a glider that resembles the baseball stadium from Los Angeles Laps 3 with the Mario Kart logo printed on the outside and on the field. Several advertisements are also featured lining the field, and the scoreboard features the names of Mario and Wario. The Home-Field Glider improves the chances of getting Super Horns from Item Boxes and increases the number of bonus points earned for hitting drivers with Super Horns.
A gold variant called the Gold Home-Field Glider, also classified as a High-End glider, debuted alongside the Home-Field Glider in the 2021 Los Angeles Tour.

The Home-Field Glider is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and it does not currently appear in the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows its availability by tour.
