Jinnie (originally known as Fautso) is a fat genie-like enemy in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. Its original name is likely a cross between "fatso" and "Faust", while its later name is a pun on "genie"/"djinni". A Jinnie can only be summoned to battle by a Pleaseno. Its thought suggests that it was being held captive by the Pleaseno and was forced to fight Mario. Its Monster List description in the remake confirms this. In battle, it is resistant against most status effects such as fire and thunder, but it is weak against ice and jump attacks. It is proficient in using the spells Meteor Blast, Boulder and Aurora Flash. Overall, it has stats that are well rounded, but inferior to Pleaseno. However, the reward for defeating the Jinnie is low, because the player gains 5 exp. with no coins or items.
