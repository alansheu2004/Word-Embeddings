Vases also called pots or flower pots, appear in the Super Mario franchise as interactable objects primarily in the Yoshi's Island series. These vases are first seen in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, are roughly the size of Yoshi, and commonly appear in castles. They can be pushed down, breaking when they fall off a platform and revealing contents (usually a key). One of these vases is even "powered up" by Kamek, forming Roger the Potted Ghost. In Yoshi's Island DS, vases appear and similar objects are utilized by the Potted Ghost enemy. In Yoshi's Crafted World, they return and can be found as a craft.
On the Yoshi's Island course in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart Tour, two vases can be seen on ledges in front of windows inside the castle.
A small handful of vases can be seen spread out in Princess Peach: Showtime!, a notable example being a postgame purchaseable decoration set at the Lobby Shop for Sparkle Theater 2F called "Flower Vases".
