The Masher is a hammer weapon for Mario in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Its artwork is based on the kine hammers used to prepare mochi rice cakes. It acts just like the game's other hammer items and like them, a Timed Hit can be performed by pressing the button again as Mario swings it. Unlike other hammers, it has a base attack power of 50 points with an extremely wide range of random variation, with up to 30 points above or below. As such, its attack strength can be as low as 20 or as high as 80, making it highly unpredictable. There is only one Masher in the game, which can be found in a treasure box in Booster Tower. To reach it, Mario needs to fall or jump from a specific balcony and land precisely on one end of a seesaw, propelling a Bob-omb upwards. When it lands, Mario is launched up to the box, opening it and causing the Masher to land on his head. If the player misses the seesaw or lands on it but gets off before the Bob-omb lands, they will need to climb back up the tower to try again. It can be sold for 80 coins, but cannot be replaced.
