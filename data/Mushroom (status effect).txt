Mushroom is a mostly negative status effect featured in the Super Mario franchise. It makes its only appearance so far during the events of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, where it is one of two status effects that changes the form of its victim, the other being Scarecrow. If Mario or one of his allies gets affected by this status effect, they transform into a pudgy Mushroom of a specific color (depending on who gets transformed). While being in Mushroom form, a character recovers a small amount of HP every turn, but otherwise is forced into a Defend command, effectively completely petrified from doing anything but receiving halved damage until the effect wears off or the character's status is restored. Mario and his friends can get affected by this status effect when they are hit by an attack like Petal Blast. It can be completely evaded if a character wears a status effect negating item like a Trueform Pin or a Safety Badge.
