Ice Flow is the second level of World 4 in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. This level has two long frozen rivers with Cooligans sliding down each river. Hitting a Cooligan will knock the player back a short distance, and it causes the player to take damage. Coins also slide down every once in a while.

Ice Flow has two very long frozen rivers, with a cave with a mountain climb inside following the first river, and a mountain with the Comet Piece. On the first river, collecting 100 coins (from the coins that slide down) causes a Big 1-UP sticker to slide down. On the second river, collecting another 100 coins gives a Big Shiny 1-UP sticker. 
In the area with the Comet Piece, there is a Flashy Slaphammer and Secret Door Sticker on the wall of a cliff. In order to get the stickers, Mario must first jump below them to reveal three Hidden Blocks, then use the Hammer to the right of the Comet Piece, revealing another trail of five Hidden Blocks. After this, he can jump to the first set of blocks to obtain the stickers. Both Hidden Block clusters are indicated by blue wilting flowers.

Above the leftmost cliff of the final map are 4 stumps with a spot above each.
