Burrbos are a small spiked seed type enemy in Super Mario Odyssey. They debut in the Cascade Kingdom, and return in the Seaside Kingdom, Dark Side, Metro Kingdom, Ruined Kingdom, Bowser's Kingdom, Mushroom Kingdom and the Darker Side. They come in five different colors: green, salmon, yellow, magenta and cyan. They attack by hopping towards Mario. They have two legs and no arms, they are found in large groups, and can be defeated easily with a Cap Throw, but they cannot be jumped on because of their spikes. They cannot be captured and more will rise from the ground when the others are defeated. The design for their eyes closely resembles Cappy's, while the design for their mouths resemble those of Goombas.
Purple Burrbos also appear during the fight against the Ruined Dragon. They do not have mouths, but instead have two small red and white circles for their eyes. They come out of spots previously occupied by sword-shaped pins on the dragon's head and try to attack Mario with electricity and can hop towards him faster than normal ones.
Burrbos were designed as being even weaker than Goombas, despite the Goomba being the "basic enemy" of the Super Mario franchise.

Their name comes from "burr," referring to the burrs of unpeeled chestnuts, and「坊」(bō), an affectionate suffix for boys in Japanese; it is also evocative of「クリボー」(Kuribō), the Japanese name for Goomba, likely in reference to their Goomba-like face.
