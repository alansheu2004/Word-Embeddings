Electric Wario is a reaction in the Wario Land series that involves Wario getting stunned by electricity. When shocked, Wario is knocked backwards and bounces on the ground a few times. In Wario Land 3, his electrified body destroys enemies. The reaction causes Wario to be knocked back for a bit, where he remains paralyzed and dazed for a few seconds before returning back to normal. Unlike most other reactions, this form has no dedicated music.

In Wario Land 3, the reaction is triggered by a Webber, denki, or Mr. Moon's projectile electric attacks; when contact is made, Wario will fall straight to the ground, bounce a bit, and hold stock-still to remove the shock from his body. Any enemies touching him will be immediately defeated.

In Wario Land: Shake It!, Wario undergoes a similar effect when he touches an electrified Floating Bandinero. However, unlike in Wario Land 3, Wario does not defeat enemies upon coming into contact with them while in this form, instead losing a hit point.

In Mario Golf: Super Rush, Electric Wario is triggered after Wario harnesses electricity from a lightning cloud for his Special Shot Lightning Blast, electrocuting him. This allows him to conduct the golf ball with electricity after hitting it with a golf club to summon a lightning cloud above it from where it lands. Wario himself loses the electric charge after hitting the golf ball. The lightning cloud prevents any other character from hitting the ball at a high enough power within its range.
