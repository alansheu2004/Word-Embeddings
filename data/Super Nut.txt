Super Nuts are consumables used by Mario and Luigi in the Mario & Luigi series. They restore Heart Points to both brothers during a single turn. In Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, they are replaced by Super Drops. 

Super Nuts first appear in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, restoring 40 HP for both brothers. It can be bought from Castle Town Item Shop after Mom Piranha is defeated for 80 coins, as well as from Little Fungitown Item Shop as soon as it opens for the same price. A couple enemies have a chance of dropping a Super Nut when defeated: Trunkle's smaller counterparts have a 100% chance, and Troopeas have a 100% chance only when the Game Boy Horror SP is equipped.

Super Nuts return in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. As in the previous installment, they are able to restore 40 Heart Points to both Mario and Luigi. Fawflants have a 30% chance of dropping a Super Nut after a battle, Mawful Moles and Pwallops have a 10% chance, and Pendrils have a 5% chance.

Super Nuts reappear in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. While they function the same, they now restore 30 Heart Points instead of 40. They cost 20 coins at any of the shops. Flounderflages have a 6% chance of dropping one after Mario and Luigi defeat them, and Hermite Crabs have a 5% chance.

Super Nuts in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam have the same texture used in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, and heal 15 Heart Points.
