Letter Blocks, originally known as letters, are collectibles that appear in Mario vs. Donkey Kong and its remake. In the original version, they appear as green blocks with striped red letters. There is a total of three Letter Blocks that spell out "TOY," considerably similar to the K-O-N-G Letters from the Donkey Kong Country series, and they appear only in the Mini-Mario levels before the boss fight of each world, replacing the presents from the other levels.
Letter Blocks do not appear in any of the plus levels. Letter Blocks can be collected only by Mini-Marios, and Mario passes through a Letter Block if he tries to collect it. Each Letter Block is worth 500 points, and when all three are collected in the level, the toy box can be unlocked to complete the level. In the Nintendo Switch remake, the Letter Blocks' appearance have been changed to white-and-blue tiles with orange letters in the modern Super Mario typeface, and they no longer give points when collected.
