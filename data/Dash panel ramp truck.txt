A dash panel ramp truck is an obstacle in the Mario Kart series. Dash panel ramp trucks are red vehicle transporters used by the Mario Automobile Association with the backs let down to be used as ramps, white rear ends, Wario Motors logos on the front, and four flashing red lights on top with one in each corner.

In Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, two dash panel ramp trucks drive along with the other traffic on N64 Toad's Turnpike, but they are removed during Battle Mode. If the player drives into the front or side of one of these trucks, they briefly flip over, and the truck may honk its horn at them. Although the trucks cannot be entirely removed, they can be briefly launched into the air if driven into from the front or side while using a Super Star or Bullet Bill or if hit by a Spiny Shell. Unlike most other vehicle types, they are immune to Super Horns. If the player drives up the back of a truck, the player is able to use it as a glide ramp, allowing them to glide over the other vehicles and access the ramps on top of some of the cargo trucks and buses. The ramp on the truck also includes a dash panel to boost their takeoff from the glide ramp, which can also be boosted by performing a trick off the top of the ramp, similar to the trucks carrying surfboards.

In Mario Kart Tour, stationary trucks appear on numerous courses, though they almost always have either a regular ramp or a dash panel ramp. The only course to feature a truck with a glide ramp is New York Minute 4. The glider truck in question does not have a dash panel like its Mario Kart 8 version.
