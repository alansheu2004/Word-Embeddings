The Planet Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the Rosalina Tour, it is a variant of the Wario Wing with pictures of stars and planets from the Solar System (specifically Saturn, Uranus, and Mars with a more pinkish color). It is also slightly similar to the Luma Parafoil with its color scheme. Unlike the Wario Wing, hitting racers with Lightning awards more points than usual when using this glider. It became the signature glider of Rosalina (Halloween) in the Space Tour. 

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Planet Glider is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's availability by tour.
