The Rocket, also called the Rocket Ship (or Rocketship), is an item in Super Mario Bros. 2 and its reissues in Super Mario All-Stars and Super Mario Advance. It can be plucked from the ground, just like Vegetables, and acts as the "door" to the next area, taking Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach upwards. After a certain height, the player's character jumps out of it, and it explodes shortly afterwards. After reaching the next area of the said levels, all characters except for Luigi jump out of the Mini Rocket in a ducking position. The Rocket appears only in World 4-1, World 4-2, and World 7-1. In the Super Mario-kun adaption, Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Toad defeat Clawgrip with a rocket.
Rockets also appear in Yoshi's Island DS, where Yoshi goes inside a hut and comes out of a launch pad. They appear in The Fort of Moltz the Very Goonie and At Last, Bowser's Castle!
Rockets appear in Super Mario 3D World and its reissue. After Meowser is defeated, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket in World 1, which leads to World Star set in space. Rockets also appear at the ends of World Star and World Flower, both of which lead to World Mushroom and World Crown, respectively, after the players have met the requirements.
A Bros. Attack for Mario in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam, called Rocket Blast, involves Mario and Luigi using a rocket to attack enemies.
Rockets return in Super Mario Odyssey, where they are known as Mini Rockets. Mario must capture them with Cappy to use them, then the player must hold  or  to blast off. They land in a bonus area floating high in the air, and can return to the place they left either through the original rocket or with the rocket at the end of the area.
