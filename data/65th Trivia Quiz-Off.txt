The 65th Trivia Quiz-Off, originally known as the 65th Super Fun Quirk Quiz, is a quiz that appears in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door along with its Switch remake. It is hosted at Petal Meadows, where the gate to the Shhwonk Fortress is. Mario triggers this quiz by pressing  when near the Thwomp, and when he does, the Thwomp will open its eyes and start the quiz. If Mario answers three questions wrong, he must fight four Clefts, but if he correctly answers five questions, the Thwomp will then begrudgingly allow Mario to pass without triggering a battle. It succeeds the 64th Trivia Quiz-Off from Paper Mario, and precedes the 66th Trivia Quiz-Off held in X-Naut Fortress.
