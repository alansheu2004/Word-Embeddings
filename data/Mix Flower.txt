Mix Flowers are a Bros. Item used in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. When used, the quartet splits up and surrounds the enemy group. One Mario brother will be holding a large fireball. The other three Mario brothers will be holding small iceballs. The player must hit the button of the brother with the large fireball to build a huge fireball over the enemy group. The fireball will switch to other members, who must have their corresponding buttons pressed. If a wrong member has their button pressed, they shoot small iceballs instead, which decrease the huge fireball's size. Eventually, the huge fireball will fall, exploding and doing major damage to the entire enemy group based on its size. Regardless of how long the player keeps the attack going, the attack's damage caps at 999 damage. This attack, however, despite it being the strongest single-hit Bros. Item in the game, can only do 1 damage to enemies with 999 defense, such as Shroob-ombs and Elder Princess Shroob in her second phase while her crown is active. Mix Flowers also only do one damage to Dark Boos and red Wonder Thwacks.
