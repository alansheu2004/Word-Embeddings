A star (originally formatted as Star), or Star Man, is an item in the Yoshi's Island series. Stars appear from certain defeated enemies and some Winged Clouds or from dropping an enemy or egg inside a tulip. Winged Clouds can hold five stars, while tulips spit out eight stars. However, if a Yoshi has reached the maximum number of stars, these stars are replaced by coins. There are also packs of stars that come in 10 or 20. Two of them also appear if a Red Egg hits an enemy. These stars are used when Baby Mario falls off a Yoshi's back. The stars create a bubble around Baby Mario, protecting him from Toadies until it is depleted. Every star collected adds one more second to the Countdown Timer, maxing at 30. Checkpoint Rings give a Yoshi ten more seconds as he passes through them. Should the player recover Baby Mario with fewer than 10 stars remaining, the counter gradually refills to 10. In Yoshi's Story, a type of coin acts similarly to the Stars, while in Yoshi's Woolly World and Yoshi's Crafted World, stars are replaced by Hearts.
Shy Guys turn into stars when Yoshi performs the Ground Pound in the Yoshi microgame of WarioWare: D.I.Y.
Stars appear at Universal Studios Hollywood's Super Nintendo World in the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge queue. They lack mouths, looking more like the Super Star.
