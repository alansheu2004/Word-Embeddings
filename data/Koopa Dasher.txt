The Koopa Dasher (or the Koopa Wing) is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It is shaped like a Green Shell with a "K" on the front. In early screenshots, it had an "N", because Koopa Troopa's Japanese name is Nokonoko.

The Koopa Dasher first appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! as the signature kart of Koopa Troopa. It is a lightweight kart available by default. The Koopa Dasher is unique among the other lightweight karts, being larger with a little more weight compared to the others, allowing it to withstand hits from heavier karts better. It also has below-average speed, good acceleration, and decent handling. Its speed and acceleration are tied with the Rattle Buggy and the Boo Pipes, with the latter stat being slightly stronger than the Toad Kart's. Additionally, the Koopa Dasher bounces more than the Toad Kart and Rattle Buggy despite being heavier than them.

The Koopa Dasher returns in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a Normal kart. It no longer has a "K" on it, being replaced by the driver's emblem, the platform is absent, and its wheels no longer resemble shells. In the beta version, the kart used the Pipe Frame's tires, but in the final game, it uses the Turbo Yoshi's tires. The Koopa Dasher increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the number of points earned upon performing a Rocket Start.
The game also introduces a Dry Bones-themed variant of the Koopa Dasher, aptly named the Dry Bones Dasher, in the 2023 Bowser Tour, and is designated as a High-End kart.
The Koopa Dasher appears in the First Pipe and Second Pipe of every tour and is a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table lists other availabilities for this kart by tour.
