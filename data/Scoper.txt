Scopers are Rabbid-wolf hybrids that appear as enemies in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, first encountered in Beacon Beach. They are long range enemies that fire two consecutive shots at a single target. This can sometimes enable the first shot to destroy cover and the second to damage the target. They also have the ability to climb to higher ground similar to Donkey Kong in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, albeit only once per turn. Scopers are weak to Burn and resist Frostbite.
Scopers wear black and purple wolf costumes, along with a multicolored eyepatch consisting of yellow, purple, and pink. They wield a weapon that resembles a rifle, although it appears to send out rubber band-like shots at their targets. They have a vicious personality, possibly inherited from their wolf DNA. When they are behind partial cover, they crouch low to the ground, in a way that is similar to a hunter.
The Spark Scoper Master summons a Scoper as an ally.  However, said Scoper has much lower health than that of enemy Scopers.

These patient observers are usually found on higher ground, where they are treated to a tactical view of the battlefield. A molecular analysis reveals that they are adverse to fire, but little bothered by the cold.While Beacon Beach is not an ideal environment for them, their long-range double-shot that forces targets from cover is highly effective... and dangerous.
