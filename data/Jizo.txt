Jizos are objects that appear in Super Mario Odyssey. They are stone statues that can be captured by Mario and appear in Bowser's Kingdom. The appearance of a normal Jizo resembles that of Statue Mario from Super Mario Bros. 3, which in turn is based on the statues of Kṣitigarbha, whose Japanese name (地蔵, Jizō) is the Jizo's namesake; a captured Jizo looks the same as Statue Mario's current appearance.
As a Jizo, Mario can move around with short hops, and shaking the Joy-Con or Pro Controller makes a captured Jizo move even faster. This allows him to line himself up with other non-capturable Jizos and obtain a Power Moon. Jizos can also be used to weigh down P Switches, which is important for some bonus areas, and they can break certain cracked blocks. Jizos can also be used to reveal coins or Hearts that are hidden in glowing spots on the floor. Jizos are immune to Spike Traps, allowing them to cross over them safely.
