Fury Shadows are enemies that appear exclusively in the Bowser's Fury campaign of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. They are black, goop-covered creatures with luminescent red eyes, resembling Luigi, which is his only reference in the campaign. They possess many of Mario's abilities, and, in their humanoid form, move around like he does.
Fury Shadows appear in Fur Step Island, Scamper Shores, Crisp Climb Castle, and Risky Whisker Island. Each of these islands has a corresponding mission with "Fury Shadow" in its name. When one of these missions becomes available, a spiky black ball of goop similar to the goop that covers Fury Bowser appears near the entrance of the island. When Mario comes near, the Fury Shadow bursts out of this ball as its eyes flare. It then laughs and begins to run away from Mario. 
Similarly to Shadow Mario encounters from Super Mario Sunshine, the Fury Shadow follows a set path around the island it is found on. The player must chase after it to land a hit, either by jumping on it with Mario, attacking with powered-up forms, using Bowser Jr.'s magic brush, or running into it while riding Plessie. If not pursued, the Fury Shadow will taunt the player as it waits in place. Landing a hit on it will cause the yellow-orange health bar above its head to deplete. It will then enter its ball form to quickly retreat away from Mario before turning back into its humanoid form as the process repeats.
After being hit three times, the Fury Shadow disappears, and Mario is rewarded with a Cat Shine.
