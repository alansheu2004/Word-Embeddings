The Mosaic Starchute is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Pipe Tour. The glider is a variant of the Starchute without the eyes that features a multicolored mosaic glass appearance and has a similar color scheme to the Rainbow Starchute. Unlike the Starchute, using this glider improves the chances of obtaining Mega Mushrooms from Item Boxes and increases the number of bonus points earned for hitting racers using a Mega Mushroom.

The Mosaic Starchute is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and it is not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows its availability by tour.
