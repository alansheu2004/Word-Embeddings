Flower Fans, also referred to as tulips, are objects that appear in the Nintendo Switch version of Mario vs. Donkey Kong, introduced in Merry Mini-Land. They are mechanical floating flowers that can generate a straight gust of wind in the direction its facing, provided that they are activated by their respective Color Switch. If any player, carryable enemy or object is within the wind gust generated by a Flower Fan, they will be floated either upwards or sideways depending on the direction it faces.
While a player is in a Flower Fan's wind gust, they cannot be controlled until they reach its end point, which can serve as a barricade that blocks off certain items like presents in some levels. However, they can still carry objects while floating using a Flower Fan. Mini-Marios can also be carried across Flower Fan gusts, which is demonstrated prominently in some levels like Level 4-mm.
