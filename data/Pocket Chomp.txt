A Pocket Chomp is a Bros. Item in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. The item's appearance is a Chain Chomp inside a small capsule. Upon use, the Chain Chomp will break free and chase the adult Mario Bros. As they are being chased, they jump on the enemy until it is disposed of, if the Action Command is missed, or the Chain Chomp hits the bro. To deal extra damage, the baby riding on the chain of the Chain Chomp could use his hammer to deal slight damage to enemies on the ground. However, if the baby riding on the Chomp's head uses his hammer, the Chain Chomp only gets angrier and faster. On very rare occasions, when released, a female Chomp will appear. It has longer eyelashes along with a pink bow on its head. This feminine variant is slower than a regular one.
Elder Princess Shroob uses an attack similar to this item with the help of a Shroob saucer and her own Chain Chomp.
