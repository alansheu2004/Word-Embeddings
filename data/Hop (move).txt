Hopping (referred to as a Mini-Jump in Mario Kart: Super Circuit) appears in the Mario Kart series as a technique usable by karts, bikes, and ATVs, barring Mario Kart: Double Dash!! All drivers can hop by pressing . In Super Mario Kart, both the  and  buttons are used to hop (hopping in Mario Kart Wii works only with the Drift option set to Manual). Hopping is used mainly for drifting, but vehicles can also hop over small gaps. Hopping has several additional functions in other games. Hopping in Mario Kart 64 can let players use shortcuts. In Mario Kart DS, hopping when going over a boosted ramp allows the player to perform a High Jump. Hopping off a ramp (by pressing ) in Mario Kart 7 allows the player to perform a Jump Boost, which gives a small boost upon landing. Hopping in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe functions as it does in Mario Kart 7. In Mario Kart Tour, Jump Boosts are performed automatically without the use of hopping.
In Mario Kart 8, there is an exploit in which the player can hop repeatedly from left to right to gain extra speed from a boost. This was fixed in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
