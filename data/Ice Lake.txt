The Ice Lake is an area outside of the Secret Mine in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. It is accessed by taking the right door inside of the Smokehouse. It is a large outside area with a frozen pool of water in the middle. Nearby is the Fishing Hut with a boat hanging on the wall. On the lake, there is a sleigh on its side and a hockey goal. The Workshop can be seen in the background. The door on the left leads back into the Smokehouse while the door to the right leads to the Fishing Hut.
During Cold Case, Luigi must go across the Ice Lake to reach the Fishing Hut where the blue Toad assistant is being held. When first entering, he can see King Boo in the background, but King Boo does not notice him. If Luigi pulls off the cloth hanging from the boat, he can view a Boo adjusting the portrait of a Toad. Nearby the entrance to the Fishing Hut, there is a hockey puck covered in snow. If Luigi sucks up the snow and carries the hockey puck to the goal, two Gold Greenies appear.
