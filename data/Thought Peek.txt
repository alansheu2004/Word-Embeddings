Thought Peek, originally known as Psychopath, is a special technique that Mallow learns in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. The skill allows Mallow to view an enemy's current HP level. If the player can push  right before the two lights converge on the enemy, Mallow will also be able to read the enemy's mind, revealing a quote. Occasionally, this mind probe reveals a weakness or even more rarely a revelation of further plot points or a point of character development for the enemy in question. The original name was seemingly changed to not refer to the mental state psychopathy; the remake changes most instances relating to mental states.
Mallow learns Psychopath when he reaches Level 6 in the original; he starts with Thought Peek in the remake. This ability uses one Flower Point (FP). This technique has no Magic Power rating, since it does not actually damage the enemy or heal the party. Thought Peek can be thought of as the predecessor of the Tattle ability from the Paper Mario series, which reveals HP and actual tips. In the remake, the enemy's elemental and status weaknesses are shown in addition to their current HP. Any enemy thoughts and weaknesses obtained from Thought Peek are recorded in the Monster List. A hidden NPC in Booster Pass can be paid three Frog Coins to fill in missed Thought Peek entries for enemies that have been encountered. The Thought Peek entries for Terrapin, Bowser, Chaindelier, and Hammer Bro, which are all fought before Mallow joins the party, are given for free.
