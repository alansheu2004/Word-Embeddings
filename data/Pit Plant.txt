The Pit Plant, or the giant Piranha Plant, is a dark green Piranha Plant with spikes on its head. It is inspired by the real-life antlion. It only appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! in Dry Dry Desert, where it is located in the quicksand pit waiting for racers to fall in. If they do, the Pit Plant emerges to swallow the racers before quickly sinking back down, causing the screen to fade to black and Lakitu to tow the drivers back into the race. A billboard warning of the Pit Plant's danger can also be seen in the course.
Similarly-acting regular Piranha Plants also appear in Yoshi Desert in Mario Kart: Super Circuit, although they spit out the racers they eat.
Though Dry Dry Desert returns as a classic course in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Pit Plant is absent as Lakitu pulls the player out of the pit immediately as they fall in. The sign featuring the Pit Plant has also been removed.
