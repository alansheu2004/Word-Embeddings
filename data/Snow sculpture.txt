Snow sculptures, also known as ice statues, ice sculptures, or snowmen, appear in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 as destructible objects appearing in the likeness of various objects and even enemies such as Goombas. They appear in some snow-themed galaxies, functioning similarly to the snowmen in Super Mario Galaxy and ice blocks in Super Mario Galaxy 2. In both games, Mario or Luigi can melt snow sculptures with fireballs while in his Fire form. In Super Mario Galaxy 2, they also fall apart when struck by Mario or Luigi in his Rock form. They are otherwise typically unbreakable.
Within the first game, snow sculptures appear only in the Snow Cap Galaxy, in which they resemble mushrooms or corks and can be stood on. Each one contains a coin. In the second game, snow sculptures prominently appear in the Freezy Flake Galaxy in the shape of Goombas, trees, and Bowser. Amongst these snow sculptures are a Launch Star, a Warp Pipe, and yellow Star Chips. Most snow sculptures fall apart with one strike, but the large Bowser statues need to be struck three times to be destroyed. In the mission Bowser on Ice, the Bowser statue on the final planet contains a Power Star. Snow sculptures appear during the battle with Sorbetti and disrupt the boss's course, but they fall apart once struck by it or if hit by a Star-Spin. The removal of the statues makes it more challenging to avoid Sorbetti.
