Kamek (Red) is a clone of Kamek created to assist him along with two other clones in his third and final battle in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. This Kamek is given a red cap and robe that has a red aura with magic triangles rising from it after the main Kamek casts a red-colored spell at him. As with the other Kameks, he rides a broom, but can be knocked off it with a jump-based attack. During battle, unlike the green Kamek and white Kamek clones, who support themselves and their allies with their magic through restoring HP or temporarily raising stats, Kamek (Red) attacks on his own.
He will summon a giant broom to try to sweep Mario up. The player must use the Control Pad to make Mario jump in one of four directions and back to avoid the broom's swipes. The broom will go diagonally between the adjacent of the four directions Mario (from the middle) can jump to with little warning, also moving back and forth in the same spot if it plans to sweep through the middle. If Mario makes contact with it, the broom will spin him around and smack him toward the screen, dealing a large amount of damage to him.
Like the other clones, Kamek (Red) will add to Kamek's magic ring attack by having a pink ring stack with Kamek and the other clones' own rings, his being on the top of the stack. Kamek (Red) is the first to close up his ring, having it widen up at a gradually faster pace, then closing at a smooth yet fast pace. Mario must avoid this attack by jumping over the ring just as it's about to close up. Out of the three clones, Kamek (Red) has the highest POW, but has the lowest HP and SPEED.
