Itodama Blocks are a special kind of block seen in Wario Land 3. They are commonly featured in levels that require Wario to transform into Ball o' String Wario and serve as obstacles, blocking Wario from accessing certain areas. These solid blocks cannot be destroyed by normal means. To break through them, the players must approach them as Ball o' String Wario, The impact will then break the blocks, clearing the path for Wario to progress further. They act in a similar way to Snowman Blocks, seen throughout other games in the Wario Land series, in that they can be broken by one of Wario's reactions when he is rolling uncontrollably. Itodama Blocks appear in The Grasslands, The West Crater, and Tower of Revival. Additionally, there are level objects that are treated as Itodama Blocks in Desert Ruins and Beneath the Waves, in which they can only be broken by Ball o' String Wario despite lacking the icon of a yarn.
