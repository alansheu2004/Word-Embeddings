Coincentration is one of Wario's minigames in Super Mario 64 DS and a single-player and multiplayer Puzzle minigame in New Super Mario Bros. Its name is a portmanteau of "coin" and "concentration." In the New Super Mario Bros. version, the graphics have been redone, appearing more three-dimensional.
A harder version of this minigame called Intense Coincentration (which has fewer coins) also appears in Super Mario 64 DS.
The music that plays in this minigame is an arrangement of the Underground Theme from Super Mario Bros. The minigame's name is used as the title for an arrangement of the Underground Theme in Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games and its 3DS version.

The minigame starts with Wario on the top screen standing next to a Moneybags; he punches it into the air, and 40 coins then fall down and make their way into the Brick Blocks as the Moneybags bounces offscreen. The player must use the stylus to tap the blocks containing coins. If the player taps a block with no coins, the minigame ends. The highest possible score that the player can obtain in this minigame is the "perfect" score of 40.
In the multiplayer version in New Super Mario Bros., the basic premise is similar, but each player instead takes a turn choosing a block. The game randomly chooses which player goes first. If a player taps a block with no coins, the block breaks and the player loses two coins. It is possible to have a negative score in this mode. If unsure, a player can pass, but they can do so only once. Once all the coins are found, the player with the most coins wins.
