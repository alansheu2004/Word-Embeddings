Shaker is a mortal blow used by Boomer in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. When using this attack, the user delivers a powerful strike to Mario or one of his allies, automatically downing the selected party member. This attack can be completely nullified by wearing a Jinx Belt or a Quartz Charm. The attacked party member can also press  at the right moment to deflect the attack; a perfectly timed block completely nullifies the damage, while a block delivered a little too early or a little too late leaves the player with only one Hit Point (but prevents them from being downed).
