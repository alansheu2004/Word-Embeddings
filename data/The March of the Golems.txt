The March of the Golems is a Darkmess Puddle battle in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, specifically in the The Last Spark Hunter DLC. It is located at the entrance to the Music Jungle on the Melodic Gardens. This battle is part of the Harmony Disruption Main Quest.
This battle introduces all three variants of the Golem enemy: Tidal Golems, Flamin' Golems and Shockin' Golems, as well as cannons, which launch the heroes across the battlefield at a fixed location. The objective of this battle is to reach the Area. After clearing the battle, the Spark Berserk joins the heroes on their adventure.

The battlefield is massive, with many Stooges, a few Lone Wolves and several Golems appearing throughout. The heroes start in the middle, which is where a cannon leading to the area is, but is locked and can only be activated after pressing two switches on opposite sides of the battlefield.
The left side consists of many stair-like platforms going higher into the air, with several Jump Panels to help the heroes reach higher. The purple switch is at the left side.
The right side consists of many floating islands only accessible by using cannons to launch the heroes to them. The yellow switch is found on one of the islands.

Both switches must be activated in order to unlock the cannon leading the heroes to the Area. As the heroes make progress, indestructible Darkmess portals will appear, containing Golems. After a hero reaches the Area, the battle is won, and Berserk joins the heroes on their adventure.
