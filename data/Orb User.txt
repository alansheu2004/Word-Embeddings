Orb Users are enemies in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake that resemble red magical staffs. Orb Users are guards in Booster Tower, aiding other minions of Booster in combat by using their magic spells. Orb Users never fight by themselves.
The top of an Orb User's body is a red head with two black eyes and two large horns. In between the horns is a glowing magical orb that hovers above the Orb User's head. Using this powerful orb, the Orb Users can use a wide variety of magical spells, primarily fire-based attacks. These spells include Flame, Flame Wall, Bolt, and Recover.
An Orb User has a very high defense rating, making most attacks deal only one HP worth of damage. Fortunately, an Orb User only has eight Hit Points, offsetting their high defense and recovery spells.
A more powerful variant of Orb User, known as Orbison, appears in Nimbus Land when it is taken over by Valentina.
