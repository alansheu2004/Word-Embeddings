Face blocks (or face Blocks) are objects that appear in New Super Mario Bros. They start out as a single block with a face on it. Each time Mario or Luigi hits the block, another face block pops out above the previous one, creating up to four face blocks piled on one another. This can help Mario or Luigi reach higher platforms, enter horizontal pipes, or block enemies. However, if Mario or Luigi takes too long, the blocks will collapse back into a single face block.
Face blocks return in Super Mario 3D Land, where they are spawned from ! Blocks. They have the same design, are often spawned in different paths, and allow Mario or Luigi to access out-of-reach locations and collectibles, though they appear for only a period of time before they disappear.
Certain ? Blocks and Mega ? Blocks in Super Mario 3D World, as well as ! Blocks in Super Mario Maker 2, create sequences of Empty Blocks similar to face blocks when hit.
