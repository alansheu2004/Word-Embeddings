The Shiny Stone is an item in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. It is obtained from a little mole girl running her own shop in Moleville by trading for the costly Fireworks. It is used as a key to open the sealed door in Monstro Town that leads into Culex's room where the player fights him. Selling the stone only nets the player two coins. 
In the remake, the Shiny Stone is a key item, so it cannot be sold or thrown away. 
A Shiny Stone can be traded to the mole girl at the shop for a Carbo Cookie. Giving it to the mole girl in a bucket gives free access to the Midas River, but uses it up.
A similar item, the Extra-Shiny Stone, is exclusive to the remake and allows the player to fight Culex 3D.
