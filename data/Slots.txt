Slots is a minigame in Super Mario Odyssey. It originates from the Sand Kingdom and is run by a Tostarenan, but it is also found in the Metro Kingdom and in the Luncheon Kingdom. To play Slots, Mario must pay the Tostarenan 10 coins, then he must throw Cappy at the slots in order for them to stop. The possible prizes from the slots are a Power Moon, a regular heart, a Life-Up Heart, and 40 coins, received by matching all of their respective images; failing to win results in being awarded a single coin. The only gameplay difference between areas is that the Sand Kingdom has three images that need to be lined up, while the slots in the Metro Kingdom have four and the slots in the Luncheon Kingdom have five. Obtaining all three Power Moons from the slots minigame unlocks the "Slots Machine" Toadette Achievement in the Mushroom Kingdom.
The music heard in the Slots rooms is an arrangement of "Spinning Slots" from Super Mario Bros. 3.
