Stardust Fields is the border region between the Beanbean Kingdom and the Mushroom Kingdom. The place is a purple plateau that contains barrels and fallen stars, as well as a perpetual night sky in the fields. The Starshade Bros. occupy the area in some manner, having access to several underground areas with star-shaped entrances. The area is mostly in the Beanbean Kingdom, though a small portion of it (called Beanbean Borderland) is in the Mushroom Kingdom. Beanbean Borderland is the first place that Mario and Luigi visit when Bowser's Koopa Cruiser crashes. The border between the two kingdoms is guarded by the Border Bros, and to cross the border, travelers must complete a round of jump rope in a minigame called the Border Jump. Mario and Luigi can also return to do the Border Jump again in exchange for Hee Beans, though they are not allowed to cross back to the Mushroom Kingdom side.
Once in the Beanbean Kingdom proper, Mario and Luigi meet the large Tolstar, who gives them the task to free Bowser from his cannon by giving him 100 Beanbean coins. To gain more coins, Mario and Luigi go farther into the fields, where they also learn how to spin-jump and high-jump from the Starshade Bros. After Mario and Luigi collect enough money and give it to Tolstar, he reveals that he had lied about freeing Bowser simply to be greedy and then attacks them. Once Tolstar is defeated, Sergeant Starshade comes back out, irritated by the noise of the battle. He lights the cannon Bowser is in, launching him away. Afterwards, Mario and Luigi head to Hoohoo Village.
