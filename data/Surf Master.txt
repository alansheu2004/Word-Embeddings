The Surf Master is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Aprilâ€“May 2021 Sydney Tour, and is the signature glider of Baby Mario (Koala) and Funky Kong. The glider resembles a white, red, and blue fish surfboard, with the emblem located near the nose and on the fins. Hitting racers with Bananas will award more points when using this glider. 
There are also two variants of this glider: an orange variant named the Sunny Surf Master appears in the game starting with the 2021 Summer Tour, and a silver variant named the Silver Surf Master starting with the September 2021 Sydney Tour.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Surf Master is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's special availability by tour.
