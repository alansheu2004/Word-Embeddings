The Fish Bone Ferry is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour that was introduced in the Night Tour. As the name suggests, it is a kart based on a Fish Bone, with an orange seat, and a spinning tail which also acts as the exhaust pipe; while the emblem is located on both sides of the tail. Its engine noise is a lower-pitched version of the Pipe Frame, Red Kiddie Kart, Koopa Clown, and Sneeker. The Fish Bone Ferry uses white versions of the Pipe Frame's tires and increases the duration of Mini-Turbo boosts and the number of points awarded for performing Mini-Turbos.
A gold version called the Gold Fish Bone Ferry was introduced alongside the Fish Bone Ferry in the Night Tour and is also classified as a High-End kart.

The Fish Bone Ferry is not currently obtainable from pipes and not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows its availability by tour.
