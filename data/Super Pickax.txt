The Super Pickax (spelled Super Pickaxe in British English) is an item that appears in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports. They can be plucked from the ground similar to Turnips. If Captain Toad picks one up, he will swing it repeatedly in front of him, breaking certain objects in his way such as Brick Blocks. After a certain amount of time, the pickax will disappear. The Super Pickax can also be used to defeat enemies, and it works in a similar way to a Super Star. The swinging animation when Captain Toad picks up a Super Pickax is similar to that of the Hammer from Donkey Kong; additionally, the music that plays is an arrangement of the Hammer theme.
The Super Pickax also makes an appearance in Mario Golf: Super Rush in Toadette's special shot, Super Pickax Stinger, added in the version 2.0.0 update.
