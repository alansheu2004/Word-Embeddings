The Mother Penguin, also called Mama Penguin, is a penguin who appears on Cool, Cool Mountain in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS. She has lost her daughter, Tuxie, so Mario, Luigi, or Wario goes to look for her. Once Tuxie is returned, the Mother Penguin rewards the player character with a Power Star, completing the mission Li'l Penguin Lost.
If the player character brings the Mother Penguin another baby penguin, she does not accept it. She insists that this baby penguin is not her daughter and that they look nothing alike.
If Tuxie is taken back after being delivered to the Mother Penguin, she follows the player character with a cross expression on her face until he drops Tuxie again. However, she does not seem to react in any way if the player character gets far enough away or drops Tuxie off the edge. The Mother Penguin also does not follow the player past the edge of the pond she is in.
