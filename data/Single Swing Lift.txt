A Single Swing Lift, also referred to as a Rotating Platform, is a type of lift in Super Mario World. It is a platform on a swing attached to a pivot point. Single Swing Lifts come in two versions. Brown Single Swing Lifts do not move until Mario or Luigi stands on them. When either character stands on a brown Single Swing Lift, it rotates clockwise or counterclockwise if he jumps to the right or left, respectively, onto it. In general, it stops moving at the point where he jumps off it. If Mario or Luigi jumps off the lift when it is at the bottom, he usually cannot make it swing back to the top. Gray Single Swing Lifts perpetually rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Many of them have red or blue Koopa Troopas walking on their pivot points, while others have Fuzzies moving around their pivot points. Brown Single Swing Lifts are mostly found in Yoshi's Island 3, while gray ones are mostly found in Chocolate Island 3 and Star World 4.
