Welcome To Yoshi's Island is a level that can be played only once when a new game is started in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and its remake, Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. It is mainly a tutorial in which Yoshi learns about Baby Mario, as well as using an Expansion Block and collecting coins. The level is very basic and short with no collectibles, with only a few Shy-Guy enemies strolling around, making it easy enough for beginners. In the SNES version, the player is given infinite lives for this level and thus cannot get a Game Over; in the GBA version, if the player gets a Game Over in this level and chooses to stop playing, the file will say that the level is World 0. This level is also called World 0 if the player pauses during the level in the GBA version; it says "World 0" at the top, and at the bottom, it says the level is "World 0-0." As the level ends, Yoshi begins level 1-1, Make Eggs, Throw Eggs.
The level is also used as the final section of Endless World of Yoshis, with the addition of Kamek attacking Yoshi every few seconds as in the first section of King Bowser's Castle.
