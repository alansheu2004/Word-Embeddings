Down in the cellar is the third story of chapter four in the game Wario Land II. It is set in the interior of a six-story building. The floors are connected by elevators. Wario's objective is to reach the building's basement which leads to a strange factory. To progress, the player has to make good use of the fat condition granted by the Cooks. The bouncy condition is also introduced here, although only appearing in one area.

The hidden treasure of this level is located on the right side of the fifth floor of the building. To reach it, the player has to go up to the sixth floor, smash through a couple of bricks and then fall down to 5F again. Alternatively, Wario can choose to fall through the gap to the far right of 6F filled with coins which sends him to the fourth floor. Here, Wario can ride an elevator to the treasure door.
