Memory Master is one of Luigi's minigames found in Super Mario 64 DS. It is a harder variation of Memory Match. To unlock this minigame, the player must play as Luigi with at least 31 Power Stars and catch the rabbit on the Mushroom Castle's second floor, on the right side of the doorway, with the entrance to Wet-Dry World.
The New Super Mario Bros. version of Memory Match is changed to use modified versions of the 16- and 20-card variants from this minigame after the player obtains 10 and 15 Stars, respectively.

The rules are the same as in Memory Match: The player must match the correct pairs of cards to clear the challenge and gain a Star, and the player must have coins to keep playing. However, there are now 16 cards upside down instead of eight, and the player bets five coins instead of three. Every time Luigi deals the cards, some of them flip, giving the player a brief two-second glimpse of the card positions before they flip back over. When the player taps two different cards, a coin is taken away from the bet number. Once the player completes a challenge, they gain five times the number of remaining bet coins and earn a Star. After every five Stars earned, the challenge increases in difficulty. Luigi deals more cards, but he also provides additional hints at the start. Losing all coins removes one Star gained from the challenge. If the player loses all their money to bet, the minigame ends.
The progression for the minigame is detailed in the table below. 

If Memory Match was a piece of cake for you, try out this harder version. You now have more cards to play with.
