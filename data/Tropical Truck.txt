The Tropical Truck is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Bangkok Tour and it is the signature kart of Luigi (Vacation). The Tropical Truck is a pink and orange truck with red flame markings on the doors, a blue seat, a flower on the left of the windshield, two surfboards near the back, and a floaty on the tailgate. The kart uses a yellow-rimmed version of the Monster tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and the emblem is located on the front bumper, the tailgate, and on the surfboards. The Tropical Truck increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Rocket Start.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Tropical Truck is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup.
