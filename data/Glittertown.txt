Glittertown is the fourth level of Rocking Range in Wario Land: Shake It! The music played in the level is an arrangement of the theme of Greenhorn Ruins from Wario World.

The level features vertical streams of water, which can shoot up and down at different heights, elevating Wario to different areas. Another feature are spotlights that shine around the area, making certain platforms visible in their light. Wario encounters a number of slot machines displaying enemies, balls, and bombs; he can perform an Earthshake Punch to stop the slot machine, causing it to produce the item displayed. After overcoming many obstacles, Wario meets the caged Merfle, after which he must run back to the starting point of the level to beat it.

The Secret Map is found after the second slot machine section. Wario needs to make his way on the second set of streams, which can take him to the top right corner of the level where one can see a platform with a small Coin Bag. Performing an Earthshake Punch on this platform reveals a secret map, which leads to Neon City.

a - In addition to the sum of 42,750 coins, the last slot machine in the level, encountered during Wario's escape sequence, produces an infinite amount of gold coins worth 1,000 coins. However, given the limited time of two minutes and thirty seconds, the player can theoretically reach a sum of coins between 65,000 and 70,000 if each Earthshake Punch stops the slot machine for it to display a coin.
