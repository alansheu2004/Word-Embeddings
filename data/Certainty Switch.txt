Certainty Switches, also generically known as switches, are objects in Wario Land: Shake It! When Wario hits one of these switches, it turns the Uncertain Blocks of its respective color into solid blocks. There are three colors of switches and blocks: red, blue, and yellow. These blocks are always located near Uncertain Blocks, and sometimes more than one of the same color appear. In the Japanese version of the game, Certainty Switches have the words ON and OFF imprinted on them, while in the other versions, there are no words inscribed on them, instead opting for a circle of their respective color in their center.
