The Double Cherry is an item first appearing in Super Mario 3D World. The Double Cherry's conception comes from the result of a mistake made by a staff member with the placement tool, which created two player Marios. The staff thought it was a good idea and decided to implement it in the game.

Double Cherries first appear in Super Mario 3D World and return in its Nintendo Switch port. When characters grab this item, a clone of themselves appears and says a short phrase depending on who picked it up. The clones keep the original characters' state (for example, Fire Mario gets a clone that also has a Fire Flower), power-ups affect all of them, and they all move identically. The clones can be used to activate certain switches and platforms. There can be up to five clones at one time. If players hit question blocks that contain Double Cherries when five doubles exist, a coin will come out instead. The clones disintegrate if harmed or if they fall too far behind, and they all disappear when the player grabs the Goal Pole, awarding 1,000 points per clone. The players can also ground-pound on other players to steal their double power.

In Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, a Double Cherry can be seen on the redesigned Tropical Grocery logos. The Cherry Cup, whose emblem is represented by a Double Cherry, appears in Wave 5 of the Booster Course Pass.

The Double Cherry appears in Mario Kart Tour as a badge icon for all challenges pertaining to infant characters.

Double Cherries also appear in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports, acting just like they did in Super Mario 3D World. They are featured in puzzle-based levels, where the player must control two or more Captain Toads at the same time.
