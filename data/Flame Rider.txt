The Flame Rider is an unlockable standard bike body that appears in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The character's logo is found on the front, but it seen on the rear of the bike as well. The engine has a Fire Flower, a V-twin cylinder with Mushroom pistons that shake, and a ? Block's question mark engraved on it. The Flame Rider offers a small acceleration boost and a large handling boost at the cost of weight and grip. It shares its stats with the Pipe Frame, Wild Wiggler, Standard Bike, W 25 Silver Arrow, Varmint, and City Tripper. It is reminiscent of real-life bikes, most notably the chopper design popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s, similar to the Zipper and Wario Bike. The 150cc staff ghost for Shy Guy Falls uses Shy Guy on the Flame Rider with the Off-Road tires.
In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, CPU Shy Guy, Bowser, King Boo, Champion's Tunic Link, Waluigi, and Petey Piranha can be occasionally seen using this bike body, with Shy Guy using the Off-Road tires while Bowser, Champion's Tunic Link (who also uses the Parachute glider with it), King Boo and Petey Piranha pair it with Monster tires; Waluigi uses the Slim tires instead. Additionally, the Flame Rider now only shares its stats with the Standard Bike, Wild Wiggler and W 25 Silver Arrow. The 200cc staff ghost for Bowser's Castle has Dry Bowser using this bike with the Slim tires and the Bowser Kite.
