Wish Stars are bright six-pointed yellow-green stars that appear in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. These stars appear at Star Hill, as they are the physical embodiment of wishes that have been granted at the Star Road. When a wish is made in the world, the wish is transformed into a Wish Star at the Star Road. When the wish is granted, the Wish Star falls to Star Hill down below.
During the Smithy Gang's invasion of Mario's world, the Star Road is shattered by Exor, splitting it into seven Star Pieces. This act of destruction prevents wishes from being granted. Wishes still take the form of Wish Stars at Star Road, but they fall to Star Hill without being granted. The various Wish Stars that dot the Star Hill landscape represent these unfulfilled wishes, which can be read by travelers to the area. The wishes of King Nimbus and Queen Nimbus, and optionally the Frog Sage, are later fulfilled by Mario, and their Wish Stars contain new wishes after being fulfilled.
Reading Mallow's wish causes him to scold Mario for spying on others' wishes and urge him to continue finding the Star Pieces. He immediately apologizes for his outburst. When the wish of King and Queen Nimbus's is read, Mallow immediately recognizes it is from them and begins to cry. He then urges Mario to hurry along with their journey.
In the Nintendo Switch remake, magenta Wish Stars appear in the second area after Smithy has been beaten. These Wish Stars are wishes from bosses who can be refought during the post-game, and their wishes change when they are beaten.
