The Starchute is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2019 Winter Tour and is the signature glider of Mario (Santa), Builder Toad, Mario (Sunshine) and Yoshi (Reindeer). The glider is a parachute that resembles a Super Star, but with yellow eyes. The Starchute provides better chances of getting Coins from Item Boxes and increases the number of points earned for collecting them.
The Starchute has four variants in-game; a rainbow-colored variant named the Rainbow Starchute that was introduced in the Vancouver Tour, an American flag-themed variant named the Star-Spangled Glider that was introduced in the 2020 Los Angeles Tour, a silver variant named the Silver Starchute that was introduced in the 2020 Winter Tour, a black variant named the Black Starchute that was introduced in the 2022 Bowser Tour, and a colorful variant named the Mosaic Starchute that was introduced in the Pipe Tour. All variants share the High-End classification.

Starting from the New Year's 2021 Tour, the Starchute is no longer tour-exclusive and is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. It would later be added to the Daily Selects set in the 2022 Mii Tour. The following table shows the glider's availability by tour.
