The Bookshelf was an activity that was part of the Lab Flash game on the Luigi's Mansion microsite on Nintendo's North American website. The game provides basic information of Luigi's Mansion, instructions on how to catch ghosts and the history of Luigi up to that point. The game also gifts the player with Luigi's Mansion-themed content such as a wallpaper and a screensaver.

The player has to click on the row to open one book. After that, they can read never seen before details about Luigi including his participation in previous and most recent games at the time. They can also explore basic information about the plot of the game. The book on the upper shelf contains methods to exterminate ghosts. However, the player can not open it and the text implies someone is holding them shut. The last book in the lower shelf is called "Encyclopedia Bootanica", which has written information on how to actually catch ghosts. Each book provides free downloadable content such as a wallpaper of Luigi's history and even a screensaver.
