The Love Toad is a red Toad who debuts and plays a minor role in Paper Mario: The Origami King. He is distinguished from other members of his species by his red spots and vest, his frequently closed eyes, and his theatrical mannerisms paired with his formal vernacular.
When King Olly first launched his attack on the Mushroom Kingdom, the Love Toad was folded up into a spinning heart amidst the chaos. Mario, Olivia, and Bob-omb eventually find and rescue him right outside of Shogun Studios, near a shiny blue pipe that can warp them back to Toad Town. From then on, he can be found leaning against a lamppost in the eastern side of town, and if Mario talks to him, he can gain free hints about the locations of any MAX UP Hearts he missed within any areas he has already visited.
Following the removal of all five streamers and the demise of King Olly, the Love Toad partakes in the Origami Festival at the end of the game.
