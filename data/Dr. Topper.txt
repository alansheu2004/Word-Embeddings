Dr. Topper (who prefers to be called Dr. T) is a character in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. He is a green Hammer Bro who runs two puzzle courses in the Trial Course in Bowser's Keep. In these courses, Dr. Topper acts as a quizmaster or a challenger, rather than an enemy. If the player cannot beat his challenges, the player will be sent back to the room with the six doors. 
In the original Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, the plastron of Dr. Topper's shell is green, rather than the same color as a regular Hammer Bro shell's plastron.
