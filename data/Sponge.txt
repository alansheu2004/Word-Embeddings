The Sponge is a set of tires in the Mario Kart series.

The Sponge tires first appear in Mario Kart 7, where they are an unlockable kart part. They offer an acceleration boost that is tied with the Wood tires, but they also hinder speed and weight. In fact, the Sponge tires offer the second lowest weight boost, the lowest being the Roller tires.
In terms of their hidden stats, the Sponge tires excel very poorly on sand and while underwater, but their air stats are given a strong boost to make up for it.

The Sponge tires also appear as an unlockable kart part in Mario Kart 8, where their appearance has been altered to an extent. Their stats have also been modified a bit in that they do not boost acceleration as much, and they are not as light as before. Their handling does get hindered to boost traction, however.
Much like in Mario Kart 7, the Sponge tires still have one of the worst water speeds along with the Slick tires when it comes to underwater performance, but they do get a small mini-turbo boost to make up for it. The Sponge tires share their stats with the Wood and Cushion tires.
In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Sponge tires are available by default. They now have improved water speed, don't boost acceleration anymore, and their traction has been slightly reduced as well. The Sponge tires now only share their stats with the Cushion tires. CPU Pink Gold Peach uses these tires with the Circuit Special.

The Sponge tires return in Mario Kart Tour, where they are used by the Soda Jet, Cloud 9, Queen Bee, Cheep Charger, Green Cheep Charger, Bright Bunny, Cact-X, Black Penguin Slider, and Pineapple 1. Blue-rimmed versions are used by the Sunny Surf Sailer, pink versions are used by the Poison Apple Kart, and purple versions are used by the Sunset Cloud and Purple Bunny.

Stat values are out of 6.
