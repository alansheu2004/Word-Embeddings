Coin piles, also known as Coin Stacks, are items introduced in New Super Mario Bros. 2. Coin piles consist of several coins stacked onto each other. The quantity within a coin pile varies, depending on how many coins are stacked onto each other; the coins act as they normally do, giving an extra life for collecting 100 of them. In New Super Mario Bros. 2, coin piles are shown only on the title screen, and the first game where coin piles are actually collectible is Super Mario 3D World. Coin piles can be found in hidden areas of levels, such as the underground area of Really Rolling Hills. They are a very common item in the bonus level Coin Express, where they appear alongside coins, coin rings, and Gold Shells.
Coin piles reappear in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS ports of the same name, acting as they did in Super Mario 3D World.
Coin piles are objects in Super Mario Odyssey, acting as they did in Super Mario 3D World. Large numbers of coin piles, called Bound Coin Stacks, can be found in certain hidden or secluded areas. After they have been collected, however, they will be replaced by smaller piles worth only 15 coins if Mario returns to the area. They can also come out of bushes, causing them to bounce along the ground in an erratic fashion, like Super Stars. Once these coin piles bounce into water, or if they bounce for too long, they disappear. These piles are worth 10 coins.
Coin piles also appear in Luigi's Mansion 3. They can be found in the Boutique of Hotel Shops, where Gooigi needs to flash the green light revealed behind the register with the Strobulb to reveal the pile of coins. As he collects them, a Mini Goob appears and signals more Mini Goobs to come. Coin piles also appear in other areas.
Coin piles appear in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, acting as they did in the Super Mario series.
