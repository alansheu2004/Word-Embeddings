Treasure Trawlers is a 4-Player minigame in Mario Party 6. The only change between day and night is that it rains at night.
This minigame is featured on a page of the Miracle Book called "It Came from the Deep." Daisy finds a treasure chest while Luigi finds the Blooper from Blooper Scooper.

The players drive their aquatic vehicles up to the center of the arena. They then face the screen.

Each character is in some kind of construction crane boat floating on a pool of water. Each player must keep moving around until their controller rumbles (or a "!" appears over their character's head if the Rumble Feature is turned off), then they should press  to let down their crane. If the crane pulls up a treasure chest, the player earns one point. If it pulls up a golden treasure chest, it gives them three points. If a Bob-omb is pulled up instead, the player is stunned temporarily. If a player pulls up a treasure chest after time runs out, they still receive the number of points that chest is worth. The player with the most points at the end of the minigame wins.

The players slightly face the screen from where they are. The crane on the winner's boat then moves up and down.
