The Machine Mades are mass-produced weapons used by Smithy during Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. They are gray palette-swaps of earlier enemies and bosses. Unlike normal boss fights, Mario and his party can run away from a Machine Made encounter and there can be special versions of them in the remake. They are found in the Weapon World in between Count Down's area and Cloaker and Domino's area, and are sometimes moved around by treadmills on the overworld.
The Machine Mades are Axem Black, Axem Green, Axem Pink, Axem Red, Axem Yellow, Bodyguard (named "Shyster" in materials for the original game), Bowyer, Claymorton, Speardovich, and Jabit (named "Drill Bit" in the original materials). The "Machine Made" Speardovich is the only Machine Made that is mandatory to defeat in order to progress. The "Machine Made" versions of Bowyer and Bodyguard are the only Machine Mades to have higher HP than the enemies they are based on in addition to the other stats.
In the remake, although all Machine Mades are still referred to as "Machine Made" when targeted in battle, the Monster List uses "Machine Made" as an identifier followed by the original enemy's name. In the Monster List entry for Bodyguard (Machine Made), it is also referred to as "Machine Made Bodyguard".
