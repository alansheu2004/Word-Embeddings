Goom Goom is a Goomba found in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. After taking on his trouble, Mario discovers Goom Goom in the Pirate's Grotto's storeroom on Keelhaul Key. Goom Goom is looking for a female Goomba companion, one that is "petite, younger than [him], and pretty, not drop-dead hot" ("about [his] age, short like [him], and Goomba-shaped" in the English localization of the Switch remake). To help him, Mario introduces his party member Goombella; however, Goombella rejects Goom Goom's interest, saying that she is already "dating" Mario in hopes of dissuading his interest, though this is simply a way to get out of any commitment to Goom Goom.  In the original game, Goombella is a slightly sympathetic, calling him "very cute" and expressing remorse for hurting his feelings, though in the remake she is far more direct and simply tells him that he is out of luck.  Goom Goom will only like Goombella; if Mario shows him a different party member, even if the party member is female, he will not like them and turn each one of them down. After Goombella's rejection, Goom Goom angrily storms off, leaving behind a Couple's Cake. 

If Mario shows him a partner other than Goombella, Goom Goom will make a complaint depending on the partner.

The following is Goom Goom's response to Goombella before he begins to woo her:

Before each unique response (including his response to Goombella), Goom Goom will always say:

For each wrong partner response, Goom Goom will always conclude (before the partner speaks) by saying:

Goombella can use Tattle on Goom Goom, but only when Mario finds him in the storeroom of Pirate's Grotto while taking on his trouble and before Mario talks to Goom Goom with Goombella as his active partner.
