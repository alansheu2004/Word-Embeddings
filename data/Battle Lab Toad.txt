Battle Lab Toad is a character in Paper Mario: The Origami King. He runs a Battle Lab in Toad Town and provides Mario with tools to assist him in battle.
At the end of Picnic Road, Battle Lab Toad is folded as a dog, barking at Mario and preventing him from passing. Once hit with a hammer, he unfolds and tells Mario about the Battle Lab. Following a question from Olivia, the Toad reveals a shortcut on Overlook Mountain, and then runs back to Toad Town. Olivia reminds Mario to go to the Battle Lab, and again once he reaches Toad Town.
When Mario approaches the Battle Lab, the Toad stands outside, reminds him who he is, and then welcomes him in. After gifting Mario a 1-Up Mushroom, he lets him use the training machines in the lab. Later, the Toad gives Mario the Timer Extender and Puzzle Solver. If Mario does jump, hammer, or guard training, the Toad advises him on his timing. Additionally, after Mario defeats every boss through the Bossotronic Fighter, the Toad rewards him with Collectible Treasure No. 15: Bowser.
His role in the game is similar to that of Action Toad in Paper Mario: Color Splash.
