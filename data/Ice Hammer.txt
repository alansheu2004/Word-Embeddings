An Ice Hammer is a type of weapon in Paper Mario: The Origami King. It is a counterpart to the Fire Hammer that deals ice-element damage, but otherwise deals the same amount. The Ice Hammer is the intermedium between the Shiny Hammer and the Flashy Hammer in terms of damage output. As a hammer, it is useful for attacking 2x2 enemy formations and bosses, but it cannot damage airborne foes and breaks after it is used several times. It can deal heavy damage to fire-based enemies, but is a less efficient option against neutral targets. It is a rare item, as it is only found only found in the blue streamer area alongside the similarly rare Fire Hammer. They can be bought in Shogun Studios for 640 coins each and earned as a price for completing Shuriken Dojo's expert round with more than 80 points after the Paper Macho Koopa Troopa Collectible Treasure has been collected. Additionally, an Ice Hammer can be found inside a Hidden Block on top of the crates in the bottom left corner of the pond with diving Ninjis in Shogun Studios. The Ice Hammer is very similar to the Chillhammer from Paper Mario: Sticker Star.
