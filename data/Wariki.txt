Wariki is a form that Wario takes in the last chapter of the Wario's Woods story arc (chapter 8) in Super Mario-kun Volume 13. With Mario and his friends removing Wario's domain over Wario's Woods, slowly bringing it back to its former glory, Wario flees from his base and hides in a tree, which ends up absorbing and fusing with him.
Mario and his friends eventually find the Wariki and, laughing at his misfortune, cause Wario to discover two new abilities: with his breath, he can knock out the fairies in the air, and turn the heroes into trees. Mario and Wanda save themselves with a gas mask, then try to burn him down, but Wariki puts the fire out with his dewdrops, then slaps Mario with his branches, almost melts him with acid lymph, and traps him in his roots. Chiyōrō-sama comes to the rescue with the Seigi no Ono, the only tool capable of defeating him, but in saving Mario by cutting the roots, Wariki has free mobility and flies away with the intention of reconquering Wario's Woods, but Mario is tossed in the air by Bowser, who came to help them. Wariki is then defeated with the Seigi no Ono being planted in his face, dissolving all of the last remaining magic on the woods. Wario also returns to his normal human form, but with the axe stuck on his head, scaring everyone at the sight of his bloody appearance.
