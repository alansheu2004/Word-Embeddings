The Wild Wing is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It resembles a professional tuner racecar with an aerodynamic front, an automotive wing featuring feathery wings on the sides of the bar (hence the English name being a pun on automotive wings and biological wings), two pairs of dual exhaust pipes below the rear fender, and tires with five-spoke rims. The Wild Wing shows a two-stripe pattern running along the hood, and the emblem of the character is located on the doors and the rear. The P-Wing from Mario Kart 8 is the spiritual successor to this kart.

The Wild Wing first appears in Mario Kart Wii as the last default kart as well as the third kart overall for medium size drivers. Its sleek, aerodynamic body gives it great speed, weight, drift, and mini-turbo. It is the third fastest medium vehicle in the game, after the Sneakster and the Sprinter, and the second fastest medium kart in the game, after the Sprinter. It is also the eighth fastest vehicle in the game, after the Blue Falcon, Flame Runner, Sneakster, Flame Flyer, Sprinter, Spear, and Jetsetter. It is also the heaviest medium-sized vehicle in the game (the weight being tied with the Phantom), which means that it is difficult for even some large vehicles like the Jetsetter to knock it away. It also has the best drift and mini-turbo stats of all medium karts in the game, the second best drift and mini-turbo stats of all medium vehicles in the game, behind the Mach Bike, the second best drift and mini-turbo stats of all karts in the game, behind the Mini Beast, and the fifth best drift and fourth best mini-turbo stats in the game, drift stats behind the Mach Bike, Quacker, Mini Beast, and Bullet Bike, and mini-turbo stats behind the Mach Bike, Mini Beast, and the Bullet Bike. However, its acceleration, handling, and off-road stats are severely low, and it suffers from the worst acceleration of all medium vehicles.
The Wild Wing has the same off-road and handling stats as the Blue Falcon and the Honeycoupe. Its off-road is also tied with the Sneakster. Its drift is tied with the Shooting Star. Its mini-turbo is also tied with the Shooting Star and the Booster Seat. Its acceleration is tied with the Jetsetter. If Daisy uses the Wild Wing, the kart's top speed will exceed the Blue Falcon's and Flame Runner's default speed by one point. Similarly, if a medium Mii uses the Wild Wing, the kart's speed will tie with the Blue Falcon's and Flame Runner's default speed.
Its bike counterpart is the Mach Bike. The Mini Beast is its small counterpart, and the Flame Flyer is its large counterpart. These three vehicles all share the same engine sound, but the pitch varies with size class. The Wild Wing moves its wings when it gets a speed boost. It has the sound of a four-cylinder engine sourced from a Honda Civic Type R, and this sound is later recycled for the B Dasher and Bruiser in Mario Kart 7.

* - Bowser Jr. is the only driver whose color for the Wild Wing's exhaust system is not shared with any others. The Male Mii's exhaust system's color is shared with Mario, Peach, and Yoshi, while the Female Mii's exhaust system's color is shared with Luigi and Birdo. Daisy and Diddy Kong both share the color of the exhaust system that neither gender of the Miis use. This is due to Bowser Jr. having an achromatic color scheme. 
** - Luigi and Yoshi are the only drivers to use an extra stripe as a tertiary color between the two secondary color stripes. All others instead have it part of the body's primary color.
*** - Daisy and Bowser Jr.'s tertiary color is used for the fenders while all other drivers have the fenders as part of the secondary color with the two stripes.

The Wild Wing returns in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a High-End kart. It uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. However, unlike its Mario Kart Wii appearance, it only has Mario's color scheme no matter which driver is using it, and its wings no longer move. The Wild Wing increases the duration of speed boosts resulted from Dash Panels and the points earned for using Dash Panels.
The game has four variants of this kart, a Union Jack-themed one called the Swift Jack, a black one called the Wild Black, Peach's color scheme from Mario Kart Wii is used for a variant called the Wild Pink and a gold and blue one called the Wild Gold. All four variants are also classified as High-End karts.
Introduced to the game in the 2019 Winter Tour, the Wild Wing has appeared in the First Pipe and Second Pipe of each tour since. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The table below lists other availabilities for the Wild Wing by tour.
