Padua (Italian: Padova) is a city in Italy. In 1592, Galileo Galilei moves there and becomes an instructor at the University of Padua. It then becomes the location of his various experiments and inventions, including his Telescope. However, in Mario's Time Machine, Bowser travels back in time to Padua in the year 1610 and steal Galileo's Telescope, and Mario later goes to the city after traveling back in time himself to return the Telescope without knowing that it belongs to Galileo. As a result of this, he talks to various other people within Padua, including a poet getting ready for a live performance, a man out on a date, and one of Galileo's students. Eventually, Mario confirms that the Telescope belongs to Galileo, visits him at the top of a building, and returns the Telescope. After Galileo uses his Telescope to good effect, Mario leaves the city by traveling through time again.
