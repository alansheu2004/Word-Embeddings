Hard Hat, also known as Buroughs, is a mole wearing a yellow miner helmet and the third boss of Donkey Kong Land. He is fought in the level Mad Mole Holes of Monkey Mountains & Chimpanzee Clouds. Similarly to a game of Whac-A-Mole, Hard Hat pops out from one of three holes and tries throwing his hat at Donkey Kong or Diddy Kong. The active Kong must jump over his hat and jump on Hard Hat's head before he regains his hat. Hard Hat throws his hat quicker after a couple of hits, and after taking eight hits, Hard Hat is defeated.
Hard Hat may have been derived from an unused Animal Friend named "Miney" in Donkey Kong Country.
In Super Mario-kun volume 15, Hard Hat is the only boss from Donkey Kong Land to appear, but not the sole enemy, as the Hogwashes appeared in the previous chapter. In chapter 6, Mario is turned into a baby by a de-aging gas. A Message Block states that the moles have a potion to remedy that when Hard Hat appears. When he refuses to give his potion, Yoshi and the Kongs chase him with the Mole Tank, but he uses the potion on himself, becoming big and trapping DK and Diddy Kong under his helmet. While going after Yoshi, he trips and Baby Mario is sent towards a POW Block which he hits, turning Hard Hat into a series of Stars, defeating him. With what is left of the potion, Mario is turned back to his normal age.
