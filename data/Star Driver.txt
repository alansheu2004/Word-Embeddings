Star Driver is a one-time attack used in the giant battles against Bowser and Bowser X in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, and acts as an upgrade to Finishing Bros. For the final phase of the battle, Star Driver is the only attack Giant Luigi can use. However, to use it,  Bowser or Bowser X must be pushed into the lava by successfully countering one of his attacks. This causes Bowser's entire HP bar to start flashing yellow, the same indicator that Finishing Bros. uses.
While Star Driver starts similarly to Finishing Bros., with Giant Luigi leaping into space, Dreambert grows the star to several times its size. Then Luigi throws the star down, with Mario riding it. The star crosshair is not present for this move. Instead, Mario has to dodge Bowser's fireballs by tilting the system. The fireballs come in multiple patterns and can shift positions as they approach. The star's range of movement is similar to a halfpipe; it appears to rotate around a center point but stops before it can turn upside down. After avoiding all of the fireballs, the star rams into Bowser and instantly defeats him. Three "replays" of the impact occur, just as in an Excellent Finishing Bros.
If the star is hit by one of the fireballs, it and Mario are knocked away and the move fails. Bowser will jump out of the lava and get a chance to attack again. If Star Driver is failed multiple times, the player can choose to make the attack easier.
