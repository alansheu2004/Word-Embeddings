The Cherry Cup is a cup that appears in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the Booster Course Pass DLC. It is the second of two cups in the fifth wave of the DLC, being released alongside the Feather Cup, the tenth cup of the pass overall, and the twenty-second cup of the game overall. Like most cups in the pass, it only features classic courses. Excluding the Extra Cups in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and the cups in Mario Kart Tour, this is the fourth cup in the Mario Kart series to feature two classic courses from the same game, after the Lucky Cat Cup, the Moon Cup, and the Boomerang Cup, as it features two courses from Mario Kart Tour: Los Angeles Laps and Vancouver Velocity. This is the second cup in the pass to feature two city courses from Mario Kart Tour, and thus the second cup in the Mario Kart series to have one of the course prefixes repeated. The emblem of the cup is a Double Cherry. The decorations on this cup's trophy are cyan.
