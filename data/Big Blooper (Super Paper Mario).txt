Big Blooper is a boss who fights the protagonists in Super Paper Mario during Chapter 3-2. Its theme is an arrangement of the underwater music from Super Mario Bros. 3.
This gigantic Blooper blocks the way through the Tile Pool and prevents Mario, Princess Peach and Bowser, from moving on to Fort Francis. There are a few options for offense against it. The player may jump on the tentacles when they are sticking up out of the water. The player may also use Thudley to ground-pound the tentacles or use Bowser's Fire Breath to singe them. The fiery-breath may be the safer choice, as the player will lose Heart Points if they miss when ground pounding, but it takes longer. Slamming or burning the blue tentacles makes the more-sensitive red tentacles bob upward with more frequency.  If Mario goes into 3D and tries to leave, the Big Blooper's tentacles will block the way.
Defeating Big Blooper does not earn the player any points, and the giant squid is not killed by the encounter. If the player enters the area where the Blooper's tentacles come out of the floor and ceiling, Big Blooper can be tattled using Tippi or Tiptron.
