Tiara is a supporting character in Super Mario Odyssey. She is a Bonneter and lives with her bigger brother Cappy in the Cap Kingdom. Much like with Cappy, Tiara's main body resembles that of an Eerie. Similar to Cappy's normal form resembling a top hat, Tiara, true to her name, resembles a bridal tiara. She is kidnapped by Bowser to be used as Princess Peach's headdress for their wedding, which is seen at the beginning of the game. This prompts Cappy to team up with Mario to rescue both damsels.
After the game is completed, Tiara begins exploring the world with Peach, much like Mario and Cappy. Afterwards, she stays with Peach on her castle's balcony in the Mushroom Kingdom.

Tiara's final design has a veil similar to the one worn by Peach. Tiara was given facial expressions similar to those of Cappy.
