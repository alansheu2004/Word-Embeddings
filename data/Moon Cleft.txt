Moon Clefts are a very powerful lunar species of Clefts found in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and its Nintendo Switch remake. Aside from the increase of power, they look and act nearly identically to normal Clefts. Moon Clefts are found during the portion of Chapter 7 that takes place on the moon. These Clefts have high statistics but are easy to beat when an explosion, such as from Admiral Bobbery, flips them over, lowering their Defense down to 0. Like their relatives, they disguise themselves as rocks, but they reveal their true form when Mario comes close enough. Moon Clefts attack by charging at their opponents, and cannot be stomped because of their spikes. This enemyâ€™s coloration is similar to that of ordinary Clefts as they appear in Paper Mario and Super Paper Mario (which themselves were misidentified as Moon Clefts in Western localizations of Super Paper Mario), whereas ordinary Clefts are pale gray in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, matching the color scheme of the Boggly Woods. Their tattle also states them to simply be a basic Cleft found on the moon. They have the highest defense power in the game, alongside Chain Chomps and Elite Wizzerds.
