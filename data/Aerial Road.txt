Aerial Road is the first track of the Bowser Jr. Cup in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, taking place amidst the clouds above Acorn Plains from New Super Mario Bros. U across an airship fleet. The track layout is similar to that of Stadium Arena in Mario Kart Arcade GP 2, but unlike that course, it is only available on 100cc or higher.

The track begins on an airship. Not too long after, a Dash Panel appears along with a ramp. A slight left turn follows, and after a small drop, another slight left turn is encountered. A Glide Ramp soon follows, and the player will then traverse some clouds. The player will take yet another slight left to two ramps, then will make a slight right and pass under three banners. They will then make a slight left and go inside of an airship before approaching another ramp with a Dash Panel that leads to the finish line.
