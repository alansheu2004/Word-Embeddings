The Pirabbid Plant is the midboss of Ancient Gardens in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. As its name suggests, it is a Rabbid/Piranha Plant hybrid; however, it resembles Petey Piranha more than it does the regular Piranha Plant.
The Pirabbid Plant comes into existence when Luigi and Spawny startle a sleeping potted Piranha Plant, which happens to have a Rabbid sleeping on top of it as well. Frightened by the creature, Spawny's powers activate and he fuses the Rabbid and Piranha Plant together, creating the Pirabbid Plant, which subsequently fights Mario, Rabbid Peach and Rabbid Luigi. Its main attack involves it shooting a fireball at the targeted character, which has the properties of a Rocket. It can Burn if a direct hit is scored, which deals 55 damage rather than 50. The Pirabbid Plant is the only mid boss in the game not to have any techniques.
When the Pirabbid Plant is defeated, sharing the same sound as Calavera, it passes out and lays on the ground. While Mario and Rabbid Luigi celebrate, Rabbid Peach walks over to the unconscious Pirabbid Plant and holds two of the Pirabbid Plant's vines together for a series of selfies. Shortly afterwards, the Pirabbid Plant wakes up, chokes Rabbid Peach with one of the vines, and slams her on the ground several times. Mario and Rabbid Luigi then shoot the Pirabbid Plant one last time, separating both entities and freeing Rabbid Peach. Luigi then joins the party.
Some challenges in all worlds, including the ultimate challenges, involve combat against more than one Pirabbid Plant.
Pirabbid Plant's boss fight level was changed during an update, which removed two Ziggy enemies out of the four in the original version and changed the positions of the other two.
