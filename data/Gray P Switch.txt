Gray P Switches (or Gray P-Switches) are objects in Super Mario World and its reissue. They appear identical to normal Switch Blocks except that they are gray with pink rims as opposed to blue with orange rims. When pressed, they turn some types of enemies into Gray Coins.
As revealed by hacking, Gray P Switches also possess the ability to transform Munchers into ordinary coins for the duration of their effect, similar to regular Switch Blocks in Super Mario Bros. 3. However, as Gray P Switches never appear in the same levels as Munchers in Super Mario World, this functionality cannot be seen in-game.
Due to a glitch, Gray P Switches act like normal P Switches after being taken through a pipe, though they retain their gray coloration.
Coincidentally, Switch Blocks in Family Computer and Nintendo Entertainment System releases of Super Mario Bros. 3 appear in a gray palette in the fortress levels. Gray P Switches themselves went unused in the Game Boy Advance version, however, and would have functioned like how they originally did.
