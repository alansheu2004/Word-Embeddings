Chucksters, also known as Pianta Throwers, are a variant of Pianta in Super Mario Sunshine. They are capable of throwing Mario a good distance behind them or above them. Chucksters usually toss Mario after he speaks to them.

In Super Mario Sunshine, a chuckster can be first found on the roof of a building in Delfino Plaza. Mario has to have at least one coin to pay the chuckster to throw Mario behind him, into an isolated room of a building that has the Shine Sprite of Mario Toss. In Ricco Harbor, there are two Piantas who become increasingly skilled at throwing Mario in later episodes. Lastly, chucksters are the main focus of the Pianta Village episode Secret of the Village Underside, where Mario needs the assistance of several chucksters to move between areas and obtain the Shine Sprite at the end. The angle at which Mario speaks to a chuckster determines where he will be thrown, which is exceptionally noticeable in the episode Secret of the Village Underside, as talking to a chuckster at a bad angle here can result in Mario being thrown into the surrounding pit, costing him a life.

In Super Mario Galaxy 2, chucksters are found exclusively throughout Starshine Beach Galaxy during the level Climbing the Cloudy Tower. Mario does not need to initiate dialogue with them to be thrown, as simply coming into contact with them from the front has them throw Mario into the air.

In Mario Party 8, if the player lands on a Green Space on Goomba's Booty Boardwalk in front of a yellow Pianta, the Pianta tosses them a short distance.
