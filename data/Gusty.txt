Gusties (also erroneously referred to as Blusties) are enemies introduced in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and its reissue. These long, smiling ghost-like creatures always travel in huge packs, and they can be eaten by Yoshis and converted into eggs. Gusties can be jumped on to reach higher areas. Gusties appear in levels where the terrain is bumpy and uneven, sometimes in endless quantities. Gusties are featured prominently in the levels What's Gusty Taste Like? and Gusty Glory.
In Yoshi's New Island, Gusties' model has a separate face on each side, likely due to the position of their faces in the artwork coupled with the exact way their transparency works.
In Yoshi's Woolly World, Gusties are made from a spiral of string, which can be eaten by Yoshi to create a yarn ball.
In Yoshi's Crafted World, Gusties have no arms and are defeated in the usual methods, along with running into the wall.
