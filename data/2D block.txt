2D blocks are objects in Super Mario Odyssey. These blocks are encountered in a 2D section of the Ruined Kingdom while Mario is climbing the Roulette Tower. 2D blocks quickly move from one position to the other in a loop. The positions of 2D blocks are indicated by a mark on the wall. These blocks disappear for a short period of time before changing their position. Mario can freeze a 2D block in place by pressing the P Switch associated with that 2D block. He can unfreeze 2D blocks by pressing Ground-Pound Switches associated with those 2D blocks. 2D blocks can have different speeds and sizes. They also come in three colors: red, blue, and green. Any 2D blocks that are frozen in place can be used as platforms, and 2D blocks are required to obtain the Power Moons related to the Roulette Tower.
