The Mario Discovery series, also known as the Mario's Early Years! series, is a spin-off series in the Super Mario franchise consisting of five games published and developed by The Software Toolworks (Mindscape), licensed by Nintendo. They are in the edutainment genre.

In the Mario Discovery series, each game is focused on a specific topic to educate the player on.

In Mario is Missing!, Luigi must return artifacts stolen by Bowser to their correct locations. To properly return the items, the player must correctly answer questions relating to the area. The answers are given by residents.

Mario's Time Machine follows a very similar structure and system to that of Mario is Missing!, though it stars Mario as the protagonist rather than Luigi. In the game, Mario must travel through time in order to return items stolen by Bowser to their original time periods.

In the Mario's Early Years! games, there are several worlds that cover a different aspect of each topic. Voice lines are present to give instructions and feedback to the player.
