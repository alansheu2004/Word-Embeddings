Nommons are a species who inhabit Pi'illo Island, appearing in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. They are mole-like creatures with large bulb-shaped heads, beady yellow eyes, dark faces, small pink beaks, mole-like claws and pink flowers growing on the top of their heads. Their lower body is never shown, due to them always residing in dirt holes. Nommons come in two colors: purple and golden.
Nommons once inhabited the island along with the Pi'illos, but after they were turned to stone by Antasma, the Nommons kept several petrified Pi'illos as play things (which they call "Nom Pi'illos") and they continued to live a simple and reclusive existence within Somnom Woods. After completing the Ultibed, Mario and Luigi head deep into Somnom Woods to find the Zeekeeper's temple and along the way they are forced to play games with the Nommons in order to acquire the petrified Pi'illo Masters they possess which are needed to enter the temple. Nommons speak broken English, saying "me" instead of "I" and removing many words from sentences, as well as debating whether certain words (such as "pilferers") are real. They also tend to speak about random subjects of which they have a poor grasp on, such as wondering if songs taste good or if they can buy the sea. Nommons revere a deity known as the Watchoverer, which could be the Zeekeeper. 
The Nommons' design and mannerisms are very similar to those of the Oho Jees from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.
