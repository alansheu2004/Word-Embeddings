The Fresh Juice Shop, also called the "watering hole" by X, is an establishment owned by Podler located in Glitzville in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Although the name of the building features the word "shop", it's not actually possible for Mario to purchase anything here.

The Fresh Juice Shop is frequented often by a Doogan, a Lakitu, and an unnamed female Toad who claims that she was looking forward to seeing Prince Mush at the Glitz Pit. Dialogue in the game implies that this Toad is covertly Jolene in casual dress. Dupree appears in the shop midway through Chapter 3 until the end of the chapter, questioning Mario on Goombella's favourite flower.
During the events of Chapter 3, X instructs Mario to visit the Fresh Juice Shop, where Podler gives him the Super Hammer. In Chapter 7, Mario visits the shop to ask Podler if he has seen General White.
A Star Piece can be found in the far-left corner of the bar, as well as another Star Piece on the roof.
