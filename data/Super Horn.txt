The Super Horn is an item in the Mario Kart series. It is a horn loud enough to stop drivers in their tracks and destroy items. It looks similar to both the Light Box and the Cannon Box from Super Mario 3D World. It is the successor to the Car Horn from Mario Kart Arcade GP and its successors, which had multiple uses but could not destroy items.

The Super Horn was introduced in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. It can be obtained if the player is 400 to 2000 units from the leader, though it is the rarest item to obtain in first place. When players use it, it emits a large shockwave generated from sound that can flip out nearby racers and destroy items, including Spiny Shells, within its radius.

The Super Horn returns in Mario Kart Tour, with the same function as Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Additionally, it appears in the Lucky Seven, which is the special skill of various characters such as Pauline. It appears in place of the Star due to it now being exclusive to certain bonus challenges and the multiplayer mode. Due to the absence of Piranha Plants as items, the Super Horn now has the ability to repel Bloopers, giving players who do so a specially-named point bonus. The Super Bell special skill has a behavior similar to the Super Horn, but it emits three shockwaves (four with Super Bell+) when used.
The following gliders increase the chance of getting Super Horns from Item Boxes, and will award more points for hitting racers with one.

In the Super Mario Mash-up in Minecraft, jukeboxes are replaced by Super Horns.
