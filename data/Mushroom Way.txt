Mushroom Way is a short path that extends from Mario's Pad in the west to Mushroom Kingdom in the east in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars.
Mushroom Way consists of three small areas. From west to east, the first is a short, winding, dirt path surrounded by trees and hills and inhabited by small groups of Goombas and Paratroopas. The first time Mario goes through this area, Mario can save Toad from a Goomba.
Heading to the northeast from there, the next area is more open and grassy, though still covered with dirt, it has a few short, rocky hills scattered on it. What appear to be palm trees grow in small groups around the area. The same enemies live there, and there are a few large flowers that can be used as plaforms. The blue flowers stay still, while the red one spins around.  Mario can jump up onto the rocky hills from the Spinning Flower. The north hill hides a Goomba, and the right hill has a Sky Troopa holding Toad, who needs saving again.
The third and final area, east of the second, is the largest of the three. Vegetation is closer in appearance to the first area than the second, and it is inhabited by a lone Lakitu which drops Spikeys, as well two Spikeys already on the ground. The area widens into a small field in the east. The exit leading to Mushroom Kingdom is blocked by a Hammer Bro, who must be defeated in order to save Toad and open up the way.
