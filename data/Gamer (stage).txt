Gamer is a stage in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U (where it is stylized as GAMER in the PAL version) and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It is based on the stage of the same name from Game & Wario. The stage takes place in 9-Volt's room at night. Like its equivalent in Game & Wario, 5-Volt appears, watching over the fighters. Her line of sight is indicated by the beams of light emitted from her eyes; any fighters caught in her line of sight will take a lot of damage and suffer high knockback, potentially blasting them off the stage at high percentages. Players can avoid her gaze by hiding behind the stacks of books on the stage, the formation of which changes with every match. 5-Volt can appear in the window, from the bedroom door, and in the TV. If the stage has a sketchbook on it, she can also appear on one of the pages; if there is a Balloon Fighter game system on the desk, she sometimes appears on the small screen before suddenly enlarging. Some of the fake outs from the original game will also appear; an old man wearing a wig may open the window instead of 5-Volt, and a cat can open the door instead of her. For the Omega form of the stage, 5-Volt will only appear outside, and will not open the window. Various variations of the stage have stickers depicting characters in the WarioWare series, depicting their artworks from Game & Wario in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and their artworks from WarioWare Gold in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The unlock match for Wario takes place here.
