The Relaxation Room is a place in Gwarhar Lagoon in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its Nintendo 3DS version. It is run by the Jellyfish Sisters, Gigi and Merri, with a Kurako acting as receptionist. 
The Relaxation Room offers a "miracle hand massage" for 100 coins, performed by the Jellyfish Sisters, which is a thirty-minute massage that focuses exclusively on the hands. While Mario and Luigi are looking for pieces of the Beanstar, they come across the Relaxation Room and, after talking to the receptionist, pay for massages. During their massage, they unintentionally perform their Firebrand and Thunderhand powers. The Jellyfish Sisters, who also have those abilities, then decide to stop the massage and teach the brothers how to use the Dash and Tickle abilities. After the tutorial, they tell Mario and Luigi to collect the Red and Green Pearl Beans in the cave underneath the Relaxation Room to pay for their services. The Pearl Beans are guarded by the Rolling Bar Defense System and require the use of their Tickle powers to bypass. After giving them the Pearl Beans, Gigi and Merri become so excited that they fall asleep, temporarily shutting down the Relaxation Room.
