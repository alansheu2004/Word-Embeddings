Starting from March 20, 2021, Tencent sponsored 12 monthly online tournament sessions in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe that were simply titled the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Online Tournaments. Each session was named after a cup from the base game (i.e. Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, etc. up to Bell Cup). All participants in a given tournament session received a physical Mario Kart 8 Deluxe medal engraved with the symbol of the tournament's represented cup; players who participated for at least three days, each from a different tournament session, also received a special collector's case for the medals. The top three players on each day of a given tournament session received additional prizes, dubbed "speed prizes".
