Eton Dorney is an artificial rowing lake in London that appears as a location in both versions of Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games. The lake appears as a venue for the Canoe Sprint 1000m Event in the Wii version, and the Rowing - Quadruple Sculls and 1000m Kayak (Singles) events in the Nintendo 3DS version.
Eton Dorney also appears as a location in the Story Mode of the Nintendo 3DS version, first appearing as the setting of Wario's Scheme, in which Wario plans to set up a snack stand there if the yellow Phantasmal Fog clears away. Wario finds a Fog machine and plans to destroy it until he is stopped by Dr. Eggman who challenges him to an event. After defeating Dr. Eggman, Wario attempts to destroy the machine, but Dr. Eggman reveals it to be a 3D hologram and runs off, pursued by Wario, as Mario and Toad arrive. In Stop Dr. Eggman!, Wario finds Waluigi looking for Metal Sonic as he is looking for Dr. Eggman, and the pair work together and track them down before defeating them in an Event. After this, Wario destroys the fog machine and clear the fog from the area, and stays in Eton Dorney with Waluigi to get compensation from Metal Sonic and Dr. Eggman while Mario, Toad and the recently arrived Luigi and Charmy leave. In Clear Skies Again, Wario and Waluigi manage to corner Dr. Eggman, but it is revealed that it is instead a 3D hologram of him. Eton Dorney appears for the final time in the Story Mode in The Grand Showdown, in which Wario and Waluigi call Mario, Luigi, Toad, Sonic and Tails from there to tell them that they have cleared the fog, and Dr. Eggman to tell him that they still plan to get their money from him.
