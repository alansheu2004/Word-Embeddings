Garson is a helpful character in the game Super Paper Mario. Garson acts much like Wonky of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and is found underground, just as Wonky. He is found in Flipside Basement 1. 
Garson owns a bar (described as a "beveragarium" in-game) called The Underwhere, and he can tell the four heroes tips and stories for ten coins a piece. The Flopside version of Garson is named Carson and owns a different "beveragarium" called The Overthere, who tells backstories about the Tribe of Darkness, Count Bleck's minions etc.
In the Nintendo Switch remake of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Garson's name is used as a wrong answer in one of The Creepy Steeple Boo's quiz questions "Whatâ€™s the name of the manager of the Glitzville fresh-juice shop?"
