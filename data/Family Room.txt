The Family Room (Family Area in the British English version) is a room inside the Haunted Towers in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. It can be accessed by taking the south door inside the Rumpus Room or by taking the door on the right on the third floor of the Solarium. It is a fairly large room that was supposedly both a kitchen and a living room. The right side of the room has a sink, several cabinets with plates and glasses, and a stove. A large tree is growing inside this room and has broken part of the flooring and walls, throwing the tables and chairs around. In the left side of the room, there is a table and several armchairs of different sizes. A jukebox is also found in this room as well as three pictures of what are presumably the Three Sisters before they died. The picture frames also resemble the shape of their mirrors.
In B-4: Pool Party, Luigi needs to go through the Family Room to reach the Rooftop Pool on the fifth floor. In this mission, there is a cabinet missing as well as the middle picture inside the Family Room. Revealing the cabinet with the Dark-Light Device and inspecting it causes several coins, bills, and Gold Bars to fly out. Using the Dark-Light on the missing picture reveals that it is crooked. Adjusting the picture so it becomes aligned with the other ones makes this mission's Boo appear. During B-Bonus: Hostile Intrusion, the Family Room may be one of the rooms infested with ghosts.
