Kikis are robotic bomb-throwing monkeys built by Dr. Eggman that were first introduced in Sonic Adventure. Kikis have made a few Super Mario appearances in the Mario & Sonic series, debuting in the Nintendo DS version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games.
Kikis commonly appear as enemies in various Dream Events and minigames. In the Nintendo DS version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Kikis are targets in the first stage Dream Shooting, where they can be defeated by a single shot to earn three points and jump around. Additionally, Kikis are also enemies that have to be sorted in Conveyor Belt. In the Wii version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, Kikis appear as enemies in the Individual and Team versions of Dream Alpine, knocking over and slowing down whoever hits them, as well as throwing bombs. In the Nintendo DS version of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games, Kikis are enemies that are defeated during the spin segments of the Mario & Sonic Download Medley, Sonic Medley and Mario & Sonic Medley in Ultimate Figure Skating. Kikis also appear as enemies in several London Party minigames in the Wii version of Mario & Sonic at the London Olympic Games, such as Vacant Lot Kiki Hunt!, where they also appear on a sticker earned from winning this minigame.
One Kiki has a minor role in Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games's Adventure Tours mode, destroying a Chao's garden in Icepeak. Daisy must defeat the Kiki in the Chase off Kiki! minigame, after which it opens a gate and allows the player to progress.
