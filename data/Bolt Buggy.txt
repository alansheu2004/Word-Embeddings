The Bolt Buggy is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It resembles the Pipe Frame with a yellow chassis similar to Donkey Kong's color scheme and a pair of headlights in the front. The emblem is located on the back of the kart. The Varmint from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has a similar design to this vehicle.

The Bolt Buggy first appears in Mario Kart 7 as a default kart body part. It boosts speed, weight, and off-road, but its acceleration and handling are hindered during the process. It is one of the only five karts to increase off-road boost, with the other four being the Bumble V, Cact-X, Pipe Frame, and Tiny Tug. Also, the Bolt Buggy is tied with the B Dasher and Blue Seven for the lowest acceleration of all kart bodies. The engine sound is actually a lower-pitched version of several karts from Mario Kart DS, such as the Poltergust 4000, ROB-LGS and Zipper. It also sounds similar to the Koopa King from Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and a BMW M3 GT2 4.0L V8 engine. It has the lowest calculated stat total of all kart bodies.

The Bolt Buggy appears in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a tour-exclusive Super kart. It was added to the game in the Jungle Tour and is the signature kart of Funky Kong. The kart uses the Monster tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and offers longer-lasting Slipstream boosts and increases the number of points earned for performing Slipstreams.
The kart also has a black and red variant called the Dark Buggy and a green and blue variant called the Green Lightning, and both of them are classified as High-End karts.
Starting from the Battle Tour, the Bolt Buggy has been available in regular pipes and is currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows the kart's availability by tour.
