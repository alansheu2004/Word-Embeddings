Buenos Aires, officially the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, is the capital and primate city of Argentina, South America. It appears in the PC, SNES, and NES versions of Mario is Missing!. It is part of the third level set in the PC version, the second in the SNES version, and in the fifth pair of levels alongside London in the NES version. Like all the other cities in Mario is Missing!, Buenos Aires was invaded by Koopa Troopas. In all versions of the game, the Troopas stole a flute from the Teatro Colon, a stone from the Obelisk Monument, and a Boleadoras from the Gaucho Museum. Luigi liberated the city by finding and returning the stolen artifacts to their respective landmarks.
In the PC version, Luigi is contacted twice by the city's fictional mayor, Mayor L. S. Ismore, while in the city.
