The Sonic Cymbals, originally known as Sonic Cymbal, is a weapon for Mallow in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. It is a stronger counterpart to the Cymbals, and like them, Mallow clashes them together to attack enemies, though it also causes the screen to temporarily distort. Also like them, a Timed Hit can be performed if the player presses the button as they collide, prompting him to open them towards the enemy for further damage. The Sonic Cymbals have an attack power of 70 points with a random variation of up to seven points above and below, making it Mallow's most powerful weapon (surpassed by the Sage Stick in the remake). It can only be obtained from a treasure box at the end of one of the action courses in Bowser's Keep. It can be sold for 54 coins, but cannot be replaced.
