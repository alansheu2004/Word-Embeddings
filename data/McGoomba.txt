McGoomba is a Goomba fugitive who hides behind Zess T.'s house in the town of Rogueport. When talked to, McGoomba states that he is "a wanted Goomba" due to a crime he committed in another place, which is why he is hiding in Rogueport. Throughout the course of the game, McGoomba makes escalating boasts about how wanted he is and the severity of his crime, even claiming he stole from Bowser himself. However, if Mario talks to McGoomba before the final chapter, he nervously admits that he stole money from his parents, and ultimately decides to apologize to them in the postgame.
During the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, McGoomba pays Mario to deliver a mysterious package to Goomfrey in his trouble. It is unknown what is inside this package (which is simply labeled "Box" in the inventory), although it is apparently something very dark and secret as McGoomba wants Mario to deliver it quickly and not let anyone see him or it, refusing to even tell Mario what is inside. After Mario successfully delivers the Box to Goomfrey, even he is surprised, telling Mario to forget that any of this happened and to tell McGoomba he will somehow dispose of the Box's contents in a way that nobody will ever see them. Mario can later return to McGoomba for a reward of twenty Coins for "saving his neck."
A Star Piece can be found hidden under a ground panel near McGoomba, as well as another on the back side of the roof of a house he hangs around.
