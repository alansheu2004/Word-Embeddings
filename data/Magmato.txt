Magmatoes are steaming, lava-filled, tomato enemies with angry eyes appearing in Super Mario Odyssey, where they can be found in the Luncheon Kingdom and the Darker Side. Its name is a portmanteau of the words "magma" and "tomato". Upon spotting Mario, Magmatoes roll towards him and may even bump into each other, although they cannot roll off edges leading into the lava. The Magmatoes burst apart when hit, and create small pools of lava which become off-limits to all creatures but the Lava Bubble. If Mario takes control of a Lava Bubble by capturing it, he can leap on top of Magmatoes to turn them into the puddles of lava and use them as improvised platforms to traverse across solid ground. Jumping on Magmatoes normally or throwing Cappy at them can also reduce them to puddles of lava, although Mario takes damage if he comes into contact with one himself.
