Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel is the fourth hotel found in the game Hotel Mario, owned by Lemmy. Its name is a portmanteau of Hyatt Regency, the real life hotel company, and "high-rate," referring to an expensive price. The fourth area in the game, it is a hotel located up in the clouds; Mario and Luigi first travel to it by activating a vine from a ! Block. Enemies found here are Koopas, Flying Goombas, Flying Koopas and Banzai Bills (though they are smaller than their previous appearance, looking more like Bullet Bills). The normal Koopas have red shells in this hotel, although they are no different than the green-shelled Koopas from previous hotels. There are also some enemy clouds which follow Mario, going in front of him to distract the player. One of the hotel doors randomly has smaller clouds puffing through; if the player enters this door, Mario will find a switch for a big fan that blows away the clouds.
The boss stage is known as Lemmy's Sky-Hideout. After Mario and Luigi beat this area, they activate a giant fan which strangely makes it dissipate and blows Lemmy away; although they believe that they have recovered Toadstool this time, she disappears into thin air as they celebrate, resulting in the Mario Brothers soldiering forward to Ludwig's Thump Castle Hotel.
