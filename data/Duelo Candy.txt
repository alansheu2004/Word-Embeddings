The Duelo Candy is a blue Candy in Mario Party 8. It has a picture of two clashing swords on the wrapper, and when a player uses it, they transform into a flaming version of themselves and roll two Dice Blocks. If they reach an opponent's space, they must stop on that space and compete in a random Duel minigame with them. If multiple opponents are on the same space, the player can choose which to duel or let the game pick randomly. The loser gives coins or (if the challenger wins) Stars to the winner. Duelo Candies are not found on Koopa's Tycoon Town due to its unorthodox method of collecting Stars; players steal Stars by hotel investment on that board instead. They are also not found on Bowser's Warped Orbit in shops or Candy Areas, but can be obtained via Chump Charity.
A Duelo Candy is also awarded to the last-place player in the Battle Royale mode (or team in Tag Battle) during the Chump Charity event, except on Koopa's Tycoon Town, where they will instead receive 30 coins (20 for the last-place team in Tag Battle).
Even though this Candy allows the player to roll two Dice Blocks (like the Twice Candy), unlike with the Twice Candy, no coin bonus is given for rolling doubles (or "matching numbers"). Additionally, after dueling the other player, the player who ate the Candy does not continue the number of spaces shown on the Dice Block. Instead, all of their dice rolls (number of spaces) are lost, and they stay on the same space as the other player instead. The player is also unable to visit Candy Shops when this Candy is in effect, like with the other blue Candies as well as the yellow Candies.
