Feelin' Fungi is a performing troupe consisting of a quartet of Toads that appear in Paper Mario: The Origami King. They are all found on Club Island, each in need of rescue. Each member of the group is characterized by a different emotion, indicated by their facial expressions and dialogue. They refer to themselves as Joy, Anger, Pathos and Humor, respectively. Joy appears to be the leader of the group, as he often speaks for the other members and is usually the one to confront Mario.
Joy is found crumpled up on the south end of Club Island, near the dock. However, after he is rescued, he persuades Mario into leading him through the tall grass to the "relaxing spot" at the north end of the island. Even when Joy is taken to the spot, he ropes Mario into finding and rescuing his three friends, who are all lost in the tall grass. Anger, Pathos and Humor are found in the northeast, southwest, and northwest areas of the field, respectively. When each Toad is lead out of the grass, they each provide a unique reaction to the Folded Soldiers: Pathos is nervous, Humor is amused, and Anger is enraged. If Mario encounters an enemy while any of the members are in the party, they will appear as an ally in battle, although they will not attack enemies unlike other allies. Once all four members have been reunited, the group introduces themselves to Mario, and will mark the location of treasure on the Sea Chart as thanks before returning to practicing their routine.
After they return to the Princess Peach, the group can be seen performing their dance routine at the swimming pool on the ship's stern for the rest of the game.
