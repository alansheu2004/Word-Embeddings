Frustration is a level that appears as one of the levels in the Summit world in Yoshi's Story. The level takes place on the peak of one of Yoshi's Island's mountains in a starry night sky and features many bottomless pits. The centipedes make their only appearances in this level, as do the Bumpties. Huffin Puffin also makes its second appearance in this level. Unusually, this level contains two minigames, when most levels have only one. There is a Melon Race in one of the large wheels that travels over the bottomless pits, and a melon-carrying minigame that must be completed with a centipede trailing behind. The level also features wooden wheels that the Yoshis must use to access further into the level. The hidden Heart Coin letter for this stage is â€™S.
Don Bongo is the boss of this stage. The area where Yoshi fights Don Bongo seems to be part of Jelly Pipe because of its background.

The high mountain air was freezing cold! How much could they take? It was scary, so high up! They carefully crossed the canyons and cliffs. Then they met Don Bongo! He was stomping mad, but the Yoshis put him on ice.
