The West Hall (West Hallway in the British English version) is a room inside the Haunted Towers in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. It can be accessed by taking the door on the right inside of the West Bedroom or by taking the door on the left in the Crow's Nest. It is a small room with little significance. There are crawling spiders and different foliage growing. The door on the left leads back to the West Bedroom and the door on the right leads back to the Crow's Nest. A hole that appears after Luigi removes the poster can show the Crow's Nest. The door to the north leads to the West Bathroom.
In B-4: Pool Party, Luigi needs to go to the West Hall to reach the West Bathroom's entrance to the Rooftop Pool. The door to the West Bathroom, however, is locked, but Luigi can investigate a hole in this room to view the Crow's Nest and see a portrait of a key on the fifth floor that can be accessed by going through the Conservatory. In B-5: Doggone Key, Luigi needs to fight three Creepers in this room before he can catch the Polterpup in the West Bedroom. In Hostile Intrusion, the West Hall is one of the rooms that may be infested with ghosts.
