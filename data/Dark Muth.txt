The Dark Muth is a powerful sub-species of Muth in Super Paper Mario that can be found in rooms 51 and 98 of the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials and attack intruders of their territory on sight. They have 255 HP (tied with Brobot as the highest HP in the game besides Shadoo) and are one of the toughest enemies that the player will come across throughout the game (they have more attack power and more HP than Super Dimentio, the final boss, although Shadoo's Bowser form is even higher). Statistically, they are the most powerful enemy in the game, although Shadoo and Dark Dayzees have more attack power. Despite this, they are not very agile and can be stopped before attacking. Naturally, they are worth lots of points due to their high HP. These enemies sometimes give players a head start and prepare to charge at the player. They are the most powerful of the Muth family.
