The Sweetheart Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It debuted in the Valentine's Tour and is the signature glider of Baby Peach (Cherub). It is a variant of the Gift Glider with pink, magenta and brown-colored gift boxes with hearts and pink, brown and red ribbons. Unlike the Gift Glider, this glider increases the chances of obtaining Bananas from Item Boxes and grants extra points for landing hits with Bananas.

The Sweetheart Glider has only appeared in certain pipes and is not currently part of the Daily Selects set. The following table lists the glider's availability by tour.
