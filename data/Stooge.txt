Stooges are Rabbid enemies in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. They wear cloaks and skull masks, which make them bear some resemblance to Shy Guys. They are the first enemies encountered in the game, first seen when Mario, Rabbid Peach, and Beep-0 land on the Darkmess Manta's back. Stooges are similar to Ziggies from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, although they lack the ability to dash. Their only ability is to attack with Darkmess Blast, a weapon which fires a single shot at a hero, and they only attack from behind cover. Stooges are neutral against all Super Effects.
Spellraisers are able to summon Stooges with their Summon Stooge technique.

Analysis reveals that Stooges are among the most common minions in Cursa's service. Alone, they are not a menace - but are dangerous in groups.They appear to have incorporated different environmental elements into their genetic makeup. The Darkmess' ability to create mutations appears far more advanced than the Megabug. Should I worry? Emotions are as mysterious to me as our enemy is formidable.

There are two variants of Stooges.
