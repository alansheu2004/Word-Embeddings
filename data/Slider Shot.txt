The Slider Shot is an offensive power shot in Mario Tennis: Power Tour, and is a stronger version of the Curve Shot. It is used by Flit and Mel in the story mode, and can be unlocked for the player's usage by having a PS Spin stat of 3. When used, the background will turn purple, and the user will begin rapidly spinning towards the ball to hit it. Once hit, the ball will be sent on a trajectory with high side spin and if an opponent returns this shot, they will be surrounded by a tornado and thus limited in control over their movement.

"A powerful Curve Shot with an even tighter curve."
