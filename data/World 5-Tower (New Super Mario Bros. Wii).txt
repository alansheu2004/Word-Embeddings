World 5-Tower is the Tower level of World 5 of New Super Mario Bros. Wii. This tower contains several moving platforms jutting out of spiked walls moving right and left. 

Mario begins the level at the bottom of the tower. He must then jump onto platforms with moving, spiked walls on either side. A moving ? Block is found, along with a Dry Bones on a platform. After another ? Block and Dry Bones, Mario comes to the top of the first pair of spiked walls. He must then continue climbing up platforms and moving bricks while avoiding Dry Bones and spiked walls. Another moving ? Block is found near the top of the spiked wall, followed by an area with the midway point. A trampoline is used to reach a platform surrounded by spiked walls. To the left of the platform, a group of coins and an Invisible Block containing a 1-Up Mushroom are found. Mario must continue climbing platforms, where he find a Red Ring and another Dry Bones. Mario then reaches another area where he must use a trampoline to reach a platform surrounded by spiked walls. After climbing more platforms, Mario reaches the red doors, leading to the battle with Iggy Koopa.
Iggy's arena for the boss fight contains three vertical moving platforms (the first and third going the opposite direction as the second). During the boss fight, Iggy attacks Mario and gang by shooting fast green blasts from his wand and jumping. If he is hit, he spins in his shell quickly in an attempt to hit the player. Iggy is defeated upon being hit three times.
