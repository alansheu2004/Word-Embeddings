The Sling Pod Galaxy is a galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy. It can be accessed by feeding 400 Star Bits to the Hungry Luma that appears outside the Fountain. This galaxy does not have any large planets and is almost completely made up of Sling Pods and other obstacles. Mario must climb onto one of the Sling Pods, then launch himself in the direction of the next pod. The obstacles are Space Mines that will hurt Mario if he hits them, or cause him to fall into a black hole. There are many Star Bits in this level.
Despite several other galaxies being smaller in overall size, the Sling Pod Galaxy has the smallest amount of space that Mario/Luigi can stand/walk on in any galaxy (including those found in Super Mario Galaxy 2), with only a very small platform at the start of the mission, the only purpose of which is to enter the first Sling Pod.
