Cyrrus is a newborn cloud in Super Paper Mario in The Overthere, reminiscent of a jump-over cloud. His name comes from the given name "Cyrus" and from a type of long, thin cloud known as the "cirrus" (even though he more closely resembles a cumulus cloud). Tippi even mistakenly refers to him as "Cirrus" when tattling him right after meeting him.
If the player brings him a Red Apple, he will grow large enough so that any character that jumps on him will bounce all the way into orbit before falling back down to a cloud above him, though if the player gives him any other apple, he will get the same side effects as Peach whilst sleeping.
