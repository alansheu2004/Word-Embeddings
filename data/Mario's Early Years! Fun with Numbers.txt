Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers (known as Mario Teaches Sums for the United Kingdom's IBM-PC release) is an educational game intended to teach numbers and basic geometry and sorting to children. It was released for the MS-DOS in 1993 and SNES in September 1994, following Mario's Early Years! Fun with Letters and preceding Mario's Early Years! Preschool Fun. Mario's Early Years! Fun with Numbers takes place on a set of islands where Mario and Princess Peach can sail to. The player can click one of the islands to enter, after which the player sees Luigi asleep. Once the player clicks him, they have to participate in various learning activities.

The SNES version of the game is generally the same as the PC edition, but with some differences due to reduced space.
