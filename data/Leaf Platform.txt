Leaf Platforms (also referred to as falling leaves) appear in the Super Mario franchise as gently floating giant leaves that player characters can stand on as platforms.

Leaf Platforms in Wario Land 3 make their first appearance in the Super Mario franchise. They create the route to the green Treasure Chest in Out of the Woods. They begin falling once the Pouch from the Cave of Flames and the Eye of the Storm from The Stagnant Swamp are obtained, creating a storm that blows them from the trees. The same level contains smaller leaf-like platforms as well, which instead vanish shortly after being jumped on.

Leaf Platforms in New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Luigi U, and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe appear on giant beanstalks. When they first sprout, they appear to be green, only to turn red and brown then slowly float down after some time has passed. Leaf Platforms appear in Skyward Stalk in the former game and in Beanstalk Jungle in the latter game.

Rolling leaves in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze appear in the level Horn Top Hop, where they appear orange and travel on their intended path until they reach the end of the path, where they turn brown and eventually disintegrate. Some rolling leaves may also be floating indefinitely from gusts produced by alphorns.

Several leaf platforms in Yoshi's New Island appear in the level Bouncy Beanstalk Walk. If the player stands on them for too long, they will eventually fall off. A few leaf platforms also appear in Big Beanie's Castle, exclusively in the area leading to the battle with Big Beanie.

Leaf Platforms in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate may appear on the Mushroom Kingdom U stage.

Leaf Platforms in the Super Mario Mash-up in Minecraft are the aesthetic replacement of dripleaves. The Leaf Platforms use their design from New Super Mario Bros. U.
