The Sticker Museum curator is a character in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. He is a green Toad who singlehandedly built the Sticker Museum underground beneath Decalburg, and he gives Mario the task of collecting stickers to put on display.
Following the destruction of the Sticker Fest and Decalburg being rolled up, the curator leads the rest of the Toads in unrolling the town (described by him as the "de-burrito procedure"). He adjures Mario to help round up enough Toads to push the roll. The group is successful, and Decalburg is restored. However, because the curator was standing on top of the roll as the Toads were unrolling it, he lost balance and fell underneath the surface, becoming trapped under the fountain. Later, the Toad standing next to the fountain claims to hear a voice calling for help, but the Toad dismisses the notion quickly. The Sticker Museum curator can be rescued by paperizing the fountain, allowing him to jump out.
After being rescued by Mario and Kersti, the curator invites them inside his Sticker Museum, which is empty at first. He explains that he built the entire museum alone, emphasizing the importance of preserving the world's stickers "for posterity." Knowing Mario's affinity for stickers, he suggests that Mario should collect every type of sticker in existence for the museum. When every Battle sticker is added to the museum, the curator congratulates Mario and creates a gallery of enemy attacks in celebration. When every Thing sticker is added to the museum, he creates a gallery for the game's music.
Upon finishing the entire museum, Mario and Kersti are congratulated once again by the curator, celebrating by promoting the two to "Honorary Curator" and "Vice Curator," respectively, though these titles have no effect on the rest of the game.
