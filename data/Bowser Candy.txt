The Bowser Candy is a blue Candy in Mario Party 8. This item has a picture of a Bowser icon on the wrapper, and when a character uses it, they don a costume of Bowser, complete with a Bowser head with a zipper on the shell in the back, and eyes similar to those of Bowser Jr. and the Koopa Kids from past Mario Party games. The Candy allows the player to roll two Dice Blocks. However, rolling matching numbers will not award a coin bonus, unlike with Twice Candy. While in the suit, the player steals two Stars from any opponents they run into. This Candy is found only on Bowser's Warped Orbit. It normally costs 20 coins if bought at a Candy Shop, but it will cost only 10 coins if the shop is selling Candies at reduced prices.
