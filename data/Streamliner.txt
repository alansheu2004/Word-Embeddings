The Streamliner is a kart in the Mario Kart series. It resembles an early 1970s Porsche 917/10 Can-Am prototype, and is blue with a white stripe going vertically across. The emblem is located on the sides and hood of the kart.
In Mario Kart 7, there is a customizable kart piece named the Blue Seven, which has a somewhat similar color scheme.

The Streamliner first appears in Mario Kart DS as Luigi's unlockable signature kart. It has slightly above-average speed; high acceleration, weight, and handling; very low drift; and a high items ratio. Its speed is tied with the Zipper; its weight is tied with the B Dasher; and its handling is tied with the Mushmellow and ROB-BLS.
The Streamliner is unlocked for Luigi when the player wins a gold trophy in all Nitro cups on 100cc. Dry Bones and R.O.B. can also use the kart once a gold trophy is won in all Nitro or Retro Grand Prix cups on 150cc. For any character to use it, the player must obtain a gold trophy in all cups on Mirror Mode.

The Streamliner reappears in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a Super kart. It uses the Standard tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to match its appearance in Mario Kart DS. The Streamliner offers longer-lasting Slipstream boosts and additional points for performing Slipstreams.
The kart has been slightly updated from its original appearance, now having a spoiler, the exhaust pipes being closer together, as well as an engine block that has the emblem on it between the exhaust pipes.
The game introduces three variants, a red variant simply called the Red Streamliner, a dark blue variant with decals known as the Decal Streamliner, an orange variant, also with decals, simply called the Orange Streamliner, and a variant with a lightning pattern known as the Lightning Streamliner. The former kart also has the Super classification, while the latter three karts have the High-End classification instead.
