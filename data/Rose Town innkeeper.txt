The Rose Town innkeeper is a Mushroom person that runs the inn in Rose Town in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. She is also the mother of Gaz. When Mario first arrives in Rose Town, the innkeeper asks him to play with Gaz. However, Gaz's new doll Geno accidentally renders Mario unconscious. As such, the innkeeper brings him to a bed and allows him to recover. After Mario wakes up, he sees Gaz arguing with his mother. He tells her that he saw his doll walk into the Forest Maze. The innkeeper, believing that Gaz is lying, gives him a timeout. Later, when Geno proves to be real, the innkeeper believes that he is just wearing a costume. Since Mario is so nice to Gaz, the innkeeper allows them to stay in her inn for free.
