Beanbean Castle Town is the central location in the Beanbean Kingdom. It appears in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. In the north part of town is a castle where Queen Bean lives with her son, Prince Peasley, her ambassador Lady Lima, and many Peas. Beanbean Castle Town has a cafe that E. Gadd owns. It also contains four shops, one for items, one for clothing and badges, an Information Booth, and a photography service shop at the right side of the castle gates. The player can have their picture retaken there.
In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, Beanbean Castle Town is seen in Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser, where Fawful is seen attacking the castle town using Mecha-Fawfuls.

Bordering or connecting locations to the castle town include:

When Mario and Luigi first arrive, they see that the town has been attacked by Cackletta and Fawful. The Bros. are late, since Cackletta has already kidnapped the Beanstar and poisoned Queen Bean with a Belly Blech worm. 
After the Mario Bros. fight Queen Bean, and cure her with Chuckola Reserve from Chucklehuck Woods, the town is shown to be fixed. However, after Mario and Luigi defeat Popple and Birdo in Teehee Valley, the town gets destroyed again by Bowletta (after she loses the Beanstar to Luigi). The town is not seen again after Bowletta's demise, though this only applies to the original game, as it can still be visited in the remake after beating Bowletta. Any side-quests not finished before coming back to Beanbean Castle Town after falling from the Koopa Cruiser cannot be completed again for the rest of the game.
The Beanbean Fields, which surrounds Beanbean Castle Town, has numerous Warp Pipes. Warp Pipes #2, #4, and #6 can be found in North, South, and East Beanbean, respectively. Beanbean Castle Town itself contains Warp Pipe #3, which is located in the Pipe House, the pipeman's residence.
