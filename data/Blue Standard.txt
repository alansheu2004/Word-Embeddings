Blue Standard tires (known as Normal Blue in the British English version) are the palette-swapped variant of the Standard tires, except with chevron-shaped treads. They first appear in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as an unlockable tire part. In the original Mario Kart 8, they share identical stats to the Standard, Off-Road, Retro Off-Road and GLA Tires, they are well-balanced with no strengths or weaknesses. In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, CPU Mario occasionally uses these tires whenever he is using the P-Wing, Toad occasionally uses these tires whenever he is using the Sneeker, and Larry and Baby Rosalina occasionally use these tires whenever they are using the Standard ATV.
The Blue Standard tires return in Mario Kart Tour, used by the Jingle Bells, Blue Royale, Super 1, P-Wing, and Comet Tail karts. On the first two karts, they have a different appearance than in Mario Kart 8, while on the latter three karts, they have their original appearance, despite retaining the same treads on the original Standard tires. Snowflake-patterned versions are used by the Cact-Ice and Frosty Bells, Super Mario Kart versions are used by the Dark Hop Rod, Mario Kart Wii versions with white treads are used by the Cream B Dasher Mk. 2, and gold-rimmed versions are used by the Frost Wing.
