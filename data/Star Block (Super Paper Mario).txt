Star Blocks are a type of block that act as goals for each sub-chapter except the World of Nothing in Super Paper Mario. They are rainbow-colored blocks with a spinning star inside. After one of the four heroes hits a Star Block, the sub-chapter ends, and the player is prompted to save. If the sub-chapter has not been completed before, there will be a brief narration segment before the next sub-chapter begins.
The final sub-chapter of each chapter is completed by getting a Pure Heart (in Chapters 1-4 to 7-4) or saving the world (in Chapter 8-4). If the heroes revisit such a sub-chapter, a Star Block appears at the end of the level which sends the heroes back to Flipside.
