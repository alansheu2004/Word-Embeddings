Wario's Crazy Caps was an online Adobe Flash game published by Nintendo to promote the release of Wario Land 4 for the Game Boy Advance. It could be played from the Welcome to Greedville microsite alongside Wario's Grab Bag and Wario's Dunk Tank.

The game is a simple memory following game. A coin is hidden under a Wario hat, and the player is shown which hat is hiding the coin. The 3 hats then shuffle around and stop, giving the player a chance to guess which hat the coin is under. If the player gets it wrong, then they quit the game and gain 10 Wario Bucks. If the player gets it right, then they are given the coin, and Wario has the player try again, but for double the number of coins as the last time. Theoretically, since the game does not get harder over time, that means it is possible for the game to last forever unless a player gets one wrong.
