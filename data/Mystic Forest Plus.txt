Mystic Forest Plus is the fifth (seventh in the remake) plus world that Mario chases Donkey Kong through in Mario vs. Donkey Kong, and as before with its standard counterpart, takes place in a forest. The background is the night version of Mystic Forest first seen in its boss stage. With the exception of Monchees, all other enemies from the original Mystic Forest make a reappearance, with no additions.
In the remake, the level select screen's color is changed from cyan to peach, under similar circumstances to Mystic Forest.

Exclusively in the Nintendo Switch version of Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a bonus level that can be played after completing enough levels. This bonus level is formatted in a similar fashion to Mystic Forest's bonus level, in which the player is tasked on using the Hammer to excavate several clusters of rocks for 1-Up Mushrooms. If the path is cleared enough, the player can then focus on catching the flying key and bringing it to the chest for more extra lives.
