Raving Piranha Plants are a species of Piranha Plant that appears in Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Raving Piranha Plants occur only in the Electrodrome, where they appear both as obstacles and as background characters. They act in the same way as regular Piranha Plants and will bite at the player if they get too close. The Raving Piranha Plants also dance in time with the music and change positions in the Warp Pipes at the end of the course, similar to the Piranha Plants in 3DS Music Park.
Raving Piranha Plants are the same shape as regular Piranha Plants, but they are covered in small flashing dots. The dots on the white areas such as the lips, teeth, and spots change color in time with the music, changing between pink, yellow, green, blue, and purple, but remain predominantly white, while on black areas such as the head, stalk, and outer leaves, the color does not change from grey. These dots match the changing colors of the Warp Pipes they appear in.
