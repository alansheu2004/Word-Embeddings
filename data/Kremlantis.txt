Kremlantis is a location in Donkey Kong Land. It is a large, semi-submerged island and the second world visited. "Kremlantis" is a portmanteau of Kremling and Atlantis, a legendary and ancient sunken city. The small portion of Kremlantis that is above the surface of the water is rather small and bleak, a stark contrast to what the Kongs find below. The submerged portion of Kremlantis consists of a large series of ruins and temples constructed in a labyrinth-like manner. Along with the various temples on Kremlantis, other notable features include a statue depicting the Giant Clam and expansive fields of seaweed. Since the entire world is underwater, there are several underwater enemies, such as Chomps, Fangfish, and Nemoes. The boss of Kremlantis is found in the eastern quadrant of Kremlantis.
Kremlantis was the home of King K. Rool's ancestors.
