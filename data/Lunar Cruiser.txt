The Lunar Cruiser is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2021 Space Tour, and it is the signature kart of Mario (Satellaview) and Toad (Astronaut). It resembles a lunar rover with solar panels attached on both sides of the kart, which are implied in the kart's Spotlight Shop description to be functional rather than purely decorative. It uses the Monster tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the emblem is located at the front and back of the kart. The Lunar Cruiser increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the amount of points earned for performing a Rocket Start.
A gold variant of this kart simply known as the Gold Lunar Cruiser was added in the 2023 Space Tour. It shares the High-End classification.

The Lunar Cruiser has only appeared in various pipes and is not currently part of the Daily Selects set. The table below shows the kart's availability by tour.
