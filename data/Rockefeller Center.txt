The Rockefeller Center is a complex of buildings in New York City, including Radio City Music Hall and 30 Rockefeller Plaza. It was built by and named for John D. Rockefeller and his family.

Luigi visits the Rockefeller Center in the SNES and NES versions of Mario is Missing! after Koopa Troopas invade and steal the Statue of Prometheus, along with several other items from other buildings in the city. Luigi has to find and return it to the Center. To prove it is genuine, he has to answer the following questions:

In the PC version of Mario is Missing!, the Rockefeller Center technically still appears, albeit indirectly, as Luigi visits Radio City Music Hall instead, which is located within the center. Despite this difference, the pamphlet description, entirely concerned with Radio City Music Hall, is identical between versions of the game.

The Rockefeller Center appears again in New York Minute, debuting in Mario Kart Tour and returning in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe via the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - Booster Course Pass. Racers drive through it in all routes of the course. In particular, New York Minute 3 and the final lap of 8 Deluxe's route have racers drive through 30 Rockefeller Plaza. It is shown to have manholes that spew water into the air, as well as a Glide Ramp in New York Minute 2 and 8 Deluxe's route.
