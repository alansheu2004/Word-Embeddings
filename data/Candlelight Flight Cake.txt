The Candlelight Flight Cake is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was first introduced in the Metropolitan Tour and is the signature glider of Rosalina (Chef). It is a variant of the Candlelight Flight that resembles a strawberry cake on a silver candelabra, with strawberry flames. Like the Candlelight Flight, hitting other racers with Bob-ombs grants more points when using this glider.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Candlelight Flight Cake is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's special availability by tour.
