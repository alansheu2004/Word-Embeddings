Zombies appear in Wario Land II and Wario Land 3 as tall, humanoid beings that are enemies encountered mainly in caves, dark rooms, at cities during nighttime, and other dark areas. The head of the zombie can be separated from the body and serves as its main weapon. In Wario Land II, zombies are seen as white or gray motionless heads that lie on the ground in dark areas. When Wario approaches them, they rise from the ground and throw their heads at Wario three times. If the head hits Wario, he turns into Zombie Wario.
