Points-cap tickets are items in Mario Kart Tour used to increase the base-points cap of a specific driver, kart, or glider. They were introduced on May 13, 2020 with version 2.1.0, but were not attainable until June 3, when they were included in the rewards for ranked cups in Tier 25 and above starting in the Cooking Tour. Since the Wild West Tour, they can also be purchased in Event Shops.
One or more tickets of the same category may be used to increase the base-points cap of an item in that category up to four times; the four increases cost 1, 5, 10 and 12 tickets, respectively. The points-cap increases at each level are shown in the table below. The tickets themselves do not add any points to the item; to reach the new cap, XP must be gained through racing with the item or using point-boost tickets. The new caps require 6, 7, 8 and 6 additional XP level-ups, respectively, with each XP level requiring 1 more XP than the previous. An expanded table of XP required for each cap can be found on the race points system page.
