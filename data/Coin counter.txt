Coin counters, also referred to as Mushroom Coins or Coin icons, are objects appearing only in the Super Mario Advance series. Coin counters are yellow octagonal blocks imprinted with the image of a regular coin on each. When a coin counter is hit, it disappears, displays how many coins are left in the corner of the screen, and counts down with each coin gained, rewarding the player if the required coin number is collected.
In Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2, a coin counter can be found in a secret area in Donut Plains 1. In that area, hitting the coin counter and getting all 600 coins grants three extra lives. Multicolored birds then come down and fly around Mario, although they do not serve a gameplay purpose.
In Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, Mushroom Coins appear in completed save files. A Mushroom Coin appears at the beginnings of the stages that can unlock White Mushroom Houses, and it displays the number of coins necessary to unveil it on the bottom left corner when hit. One also appears in the World-e level Bombarded by Bob-ombs, where it gives three extra lives for collecting 110 coins.
