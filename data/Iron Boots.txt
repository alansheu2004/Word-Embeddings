Iron Boots (formerly known as Iron Jumps) are a type of weapon that first appear in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. They are stronger than regular Boots and can stomp spiked enemies such as Spinies.
There are various stronger variants of the Iron Boots, such as the Shiny Iron Boots.

In Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Iron Jumps are found in Whammino Mountain and various levels in Worlds 2 and 3, and can be bought Decalburg for 5 coins each. They have a 1-star attack power, and can be placed in the Sticker Museum as #7. 

In Paper Mario: Color Splash, Iron Jumps appear as common cards, first appearing in Sunglow Ridge. They require blue paint to fill in. Iron Jumps can be bought at Prisma Cardware for 6 coins unpainted or 22 coins pre-painted. More powerful versions include the Iron Jump x2, Iron Jump x3, Big Iron Jump, and Huge Iron Jump. Redpepper Volcano and Toad Trainworks both have cutouts that give Iron Jumps.

In Paper Mario: The Origami King, Iron Boots deal a low amount of damage, and target a 4Ã—1 enemy formation. They are effective against airborne foes and break after being used a few times. They can be purchased at Toad Town and Picnic Road for 300 coins each, but can also be found in a number of places throughout the game.
