The Trickster is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2019 Halloween Tour as the spotlight kart of the tour's first week. It is the signature kart of Rosalina (Halloween) and Peach (Halloween). Its name is a reference to trick-or-treating, a Halloween tradition. It resembles a jack-oâ€™-lantern with bat wings on the fenders and two lanterns on the back close to the exhaust pipes. The emblem is located on two bat-winged ornaments on the front and rear. It uses a thinner version of the Cyber Slick tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Trickster increases the duration of Dash Panel speed boosts and the number of points earned for using Dash Panels.
The 2020 Halloween Tour introduces a black variant named the Dark Trickster, while the 2022 Halloween Tour introduces a variant named the Gold Trickster. Both of these are classified as High-End karts.

The Trickster has only appeared in certain pipes and is not a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows the kart's availability by tour.
