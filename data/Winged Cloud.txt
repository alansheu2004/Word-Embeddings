Winged Clouds, or Question Mark Clouds, are objects in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (and its GBA reissue), Yoshi's Island DS, and Yoshi's New Island. They appear in nearly every level, and when a Yoshi hits a Winged Cloud with any projectile, such as a Yoshi's Egg, it disappears and reveals its contents or triggers an effect. Winged Clouds can contain objects such as flowers, five stars, extra lives, and ! Switches, but they sometimes also create stairs or bridges or make coins appear instead of revealing an item. There are Winged Clouds that contain even Bandits. When being hit, a Bandit pops out and chases a Yoshi around to steal Baby Mario. Due to their function, Winged Clouds are considered Yoshi's Island's equivalent to ? Blocks. There also exists a Special Item in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island called a Winged Cloud Maker, which turns enemies into Winged Clouds.
Winged Clouds reappear in Yoshi's Woolly World, Poochy & Yoshi's Woolly World, and Yoshi's Crafted World, acting the same as in previous games. In Yoshi's Crafted World, there is a Time Cloud variant that flips the stage when hit.
Winged Clouds appear in volume 14 of Super Mario-kun, also providing items when they are hit, such as a blue watermelon. Unlike in the games, however, Yoshi does not need to hit them with an egg to make them spawn items.
A Winged Cloud appears in the Yoshi's Island course, which appears in the Booster Course Pass DLC for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and in Mario Kart Tour. Racers can hit the Winged Cloud while gliding to temporarily pop it, causing a bridge to appear. Hitting it in Mario Kart Tour also grants bonus points.
