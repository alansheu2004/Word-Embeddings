Cruising with Linking Lifts is a course in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It is found in Fluff-Puff Peaks, and is unlocked after clearing Fluff-Puff Peaks Flying Battleship. This course features Linking Lifts that the players must use to traverse. Completion of this course does not unlock any new courses. The difficulty of the course is two stars, and it houses two Wonder Seeds.

The players start on solid ground close to the first Linking Lift. There is a Zip-Zap that jumps from below the Linking Lift. When the players step ono the Linking Lift, it will follow its track to the right. Along the way, there are Linking Lift Blocks that add to Linking Lift, ? Blocks and more Zip-Zaps that attack from below. High in the sky are Condrops that pose no threat to the players and carry good things like powerups and coins. There will eventually be six Linking Lift Blocks surrounded by Brick Blocks. If the players are in Elephant form, they can break the blocks and add to the Linking Lift. Afterwards is solid ground where the Checkpoint Flag is.
Beyond the Checkpoint Flag is the second Linking Lift section that has a Wow Bud nearby, which causes the Wonder Flower to appear when activated. There are four Zip-Zaps close to where the Wonder Flower is. After obtaining the Wonder Flower, the Wonder Effect starts, which causes a Lakitu trio to appear in the background and throw coins, powerups and Wonder Tokens into the foreground for the players to collect. In addition, Linking Lift Blocks are taller and wider, and there is a time limit of fifty seconds. After five Wonder Tokens have been collected, the Wonder Seed appears on the solid ground at the end of the Linking Lift's path. Once it is obtained, the Wonder Effect ends. There is then one more Linking Lift section, but this one is short and leads to the Goal Pole. Two Condrops fly in from the right side of the screen to allow players to bounce on them to reach the top of the Goal Pole.
