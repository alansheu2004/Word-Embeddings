Pokey Mummies are undead Pokeys that appear in Paper Mario. They "sleep" in sarcophagi that line the walls of some rooms in Dry Dry Ruins, but will emerge from them whenever Mario draws near. Despite their name, they do not resemble mummies. Aside from being teal in color and being able to poison Mario with their attacks, Pokey Mummies have identical attacking and moving animations to regular Pokeys.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door its Nintendo Switch remake and Super Paper Mario, Poison Pokeys are their visual and functional equivalent, with the only real differences being that they are stronger than normal Pokeys due to being encountered later, and the lack of textual "Egyptian" theme.
