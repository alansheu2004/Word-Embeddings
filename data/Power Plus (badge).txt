Power Plus is a badge in Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.
In Paper Mario, one is located in Shy Guy's Toy Box, in a treasure chest guarded by an Anti Guy in the area to the left of the blue station. It can also be bought from Merlow for twenty five Star Pieces.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, it can be found in the well next to the Creepy Steeple, inside the same room as the Parrot, won from the Happy Lucky Lottery by matching four numbers in the original game and three in the Switch remake (one time only), bought from Dazzle in Rogueport Underground for fifteen Star Pieces, and potentially dropped after a battle by Dark Wizzerds and Elite Wizzerds. If Mario equips it, all of his jump and hammer attacks, including ones granted by equipping other badges, are boosted by one point. Moves that require Star Power are unaffected. The upgrade from the badge stacks if multiple copies of it are equipped. A variant of the badge called Power Plus P solely has an effect on Mario's partner.
The badge can be sold for 200 coins.
This badge is depicted on a sticker in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, but is erroneously listed as Mega Rush in the English localization.
