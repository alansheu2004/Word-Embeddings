The Paper Glider is a glider introduced in Mario Kart 8. The glider is based off of a paper airplane.

In Mario Kart 8, the glider is included in the Animal Crossing Ã— Mario Kart 8 downloadable content pack. The Paper Glider has a green plaid design, Animal Crossing leaves, apples, and flowers. The Animal Crossing logo can be seen on the left wing. As with the Super Glider, Plane Glider, Waddle Wing, and Wario Wing, the glider does not give any abilities to the player's vehicle. A CPU-controlled Female Villager and Isabelle use this glider whenever they are using the City Tripper, while a CPU-controlled Male Villager uses this glider with the Streetle.
In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, the Paper Glider is available in the base game and is unlocked randomly by collecting coins. This time, it shares its stats with the Cloud Glider, the Parachute, and the Flower Glider. CPU Isabelle uses this glider with the Biddybuggy.

The Paper Glider returns in Mario Kart Tour as a Normal glider. It has been redesigned, this time having a red and white color scheme as opposed to an Animal Crossing-themed scheme. The emblem is located on the center fold. The Paper Glider provides better chances of getting Green Shells from Item Boxes and increases the number of points earned for landing hits with Green Shells. The game introduces two variants named the Minion Paper Glider and the Pink Gold Paper Glider; the former is also classified as a Normal glider, while the latter is classified as a High-End glider.
