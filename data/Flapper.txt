Flappers are underwater, mussel-like foes appearing only in Donkey Kong Land. No official Western media names them Flappers. However, they are repeatedly described as sea creatures in Volume 74 of Nintendo Power, a descriptor that is not used for other aquatic enemies found in the game. The free 24-page booklet of Donkey Kong Land from UK's Nintendo Magazine System instead refers to it as Nemo, which is the name of a separate enemy referred to on the same page as Nautilus. This is also the case in the magazine issues.
In gameplay, Flappers commonly dwell the second world, Kremlantis, and appear in many underwater levels. When attacking, a Flapper claps its mantle together and propel itself upwards. After it reaches a point high enough, it slowly begins to sink. If a Kong touches this enemy while it is moving through the water, he gets injured and passes out. Flappers are often encountered in groups and swim in tight spaces to increase difficulty.
