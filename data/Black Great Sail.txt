The Black Great Sail is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. The glider debuted in the Peach vs. Daisy Tour, and as the name suggests, it is a black variant of the Great Sail. It became the signature glider of Bowser Jr. (Pirate) in the Kamek Tour, Luigi (Classic) in the Singapore Tour, and Mario (Swimwear) in the Ocean Tour. Unlike the Great Sail, hitting racers while under the effect of a Bullet Bill grants more points when using this glider. Starting from the Mario vs. Peach Tour, the Black Great Sail is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe.
