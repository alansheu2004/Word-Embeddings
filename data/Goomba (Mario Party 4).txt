Goomba is a hosting character appearing in Mario Party 4, alongside Toad, Shy Guy, Boo, and Koopa Troopa as hosts of the Party Cube. He hosts the board Goomba's Greedy Gala.
As shown in the game's end credits, Goomba appeared to be a generic member of his species until he, along with Toad, Shy Guy, Boo and Koopa Troopa, came across a blank cube emerging from a Warp Pipe. The five decorate the cube with drawings of themselves and dress in costumes to host a party for Mario and his friends. The five send the invitation to him with a Lakitu before appearing before the gang in the Party Cube during the game's opening.
During the game's story, Goomba, as well as the other hosts, are celebrating the player's birthday and promises a gift if they beat their boards. However, when the player beats the board, Goomba reveals that the player must beat him in a mini-game before claiming their gift. When defeated, Goomba rewards the player the present.
According to the Prima guide for Mario Party 4, Goomba used the idea of a party in order to gain the money one would get from birthdays. This led to the casino theme of his board. As such, Goomba can be seen as a rather shifty character and, as his board name further implies, he is greedy and values money. This trait is also shown through the various Goombas working the events of the board, with the Goomba working the giant wheel in the board's center asking for coins to improve the player's odds of reaching the Star. Goomba wears a pink top hat with a red stripe above the rim and a pink cloak just below his head.
