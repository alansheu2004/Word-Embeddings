Mario Party 7 Bon Voyage Quiz is an Adobe Flash activity published by Neopets and co-developed by Neopets and Nintendo to promote the release of Mario Party 7 on the Nintendo GameCube. 

The activity is a quiz where to win, the player has to answer 5 out of 5 questions about some of the boards in Mario Party 7. There are more than 5 questions, however, as the set of questions depends on what character the player chooses to play as, and there are still more than 5 questions per character, and some are repeated. If the player answers the 5 questions correctly, then they win. If the player does not get all 5 right, then they lose, although the screens for winning and losing are virtually identical. There is also a score attached to the player's performance. Each correct question is worth 100 points, and if all questions are answered correctly, then the player is rewarded with 200 bonus points at the end, locking the highest possible score at 700.
