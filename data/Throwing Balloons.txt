Throwing Balloons is a Mini Battle featured in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and its reissue. A Yoshi and a Bandit toss a slowly expanding balloon back and forth until it pops, deciding the loser and consequently the winner as well. Whenever the Yoshi receives the balloon, the correct buttons shown must be pressed in time to toss it back to the Bandit, which then attempts to do the same. There is a set time limit in which the buttons must be entered. If the Yoshi or the Bandit makes a mistake, the timer restarts. There is a total of three modes, with four, five, and six buttons featured respectively. If the Yoshi wins, he receives an item or one, two, or three extra lives. Using the cheat code from the world map unlocks a multiplayer version of the game in which the Bandit is controlled by a second player.
This Mini Battle can be played behind the locked doors of shacks in the stages The Cave Of Chomp Rock, What's Gusty Taste Like?, Jungle Rhythm..., The Cave Of The Lakitus, BLIZZARD!!!, and KEEP MOVING!!!! It is the only Mini Battle that can be played in at least one stage of each world, and it is playable only by Green, Pink, Light Blue, and Red Yoshis.
