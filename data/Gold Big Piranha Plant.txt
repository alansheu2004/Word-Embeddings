A Gold Big Piranha Plant is a gold variant of a Big Piranha Plant that only appears a single time in New Super Mario Bros. 2 on World 1-A. The Gold Big Piranha Plant can only be seen after activating a Gold Ring in a secret area and running to a Pipe Cannon all the way to the right; the pipe cannon will launch the player to the right of a Big Piranha Plant that will briefly appear gold until the Gold Ring's effect wears off. Gold Big Piranha Plants have no notable differences from regular Big Piranha Plants besides the gold color and giving 5 coins upon death.
