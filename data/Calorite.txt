Calorites are fiery enemies found inside the Flab Zone of Bowser's body in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. They are named after the calorie, which is the measurement of heat used to gauge the energy content of food. They will use the two logs in their hands to increase the power of their flames, and then the Calorite will begin rolling while shooting flames at Mario and Luigi. This attack can be avoided by jumping over the flames. If Mario or Luigi are hit by this attack, they might get burned and lose a few turns, unable to dodge or counterattack. The number of times the Calorite rolls is based on the amount of times they toss the logs into their fire. Calorites are also able to eat Tenderlings and turn them into additional Calorites. Due to their heads being on fire, they are immune to jumps and any attempt at doing so will harm Mario and Luigi; they must be attacked using hammers or any Bros. Attack that does not involve jumping.
Oddly enough, despite being fire-based enemies, Calorites take damage from the Fire Flower Bros. Attack in the original game (although they do take reduced damage from it); in the remake, they are healed instead.
