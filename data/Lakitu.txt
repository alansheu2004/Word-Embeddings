Lakitus are enemies introduced in Super Mario Bros. They are Koopas that ride clouds through the skies, most often dropping Spiny Eggs down at targets. Some spinoff games include a Lakitu as a referee, including the Mario Kart, Mario Tennis, and Mario Baseball games. The instruction booklets of several spinoff games refer to the Lakitu character in singular form, suggesting against the idea of those games having several Lakitus.

In Super Mario Bros., Lakitus are first encountered in World 4-1. They move on a horizontal axis on the upper part of the screen, hiding in their clouds for about one second before throwing down Spiny's eggs, which become Spinies upon landing. Only one Lakitu is ever encountered at a time. Even if it is defeated from either being stomped or being hit by a fireball, worth 800 and 200 points, respectively, it spawns after several seconds. Lakitu retreats offscreen whenever the player character is about to activate the flagpole, though one in World 8-2 stops its pursuit early on. A Lakitu is behind the disguise of the fake Bowser in World 5-4.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. They are first encountered in World 4-1. Lakitus retain the same behavior as before, but they were recolored slightly darker. Lakitus appear in some of the underwater levels, like in World 9, and in the original Family Computer Disk System release only, the outline of Lakitu's cloud is colored gray like the other green enemies encountered there.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario Bros. 3. They are first encountered in World 3-4. Some Lakitus throw green eggs that roll upon hitting the ground. In the remake Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, a different-looking Lakitu pulls the player character upward if the player selects an option to scan an e-Reader card; this is not possible in the European version, which removes all e-Reader compatibility, or in the digital re-releases, since every e-Reader level is available in them.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario World and its reissue. They follow the player character directly, unlike before, and use a cloud that the player character can ridee temporarily if the Lakitu is defeated by projectiles. This is the only game of the Super Mario series with cloud-riding Lakitus with red shells instead of green, though the remake has an oddity where if Yoshi spits out a Lakitu from a Pipe while having Luigi, the Lakitu is depicted with a green shell. The game introduces three variations: Fishin' Lakitus, Fishin' Boo, and Lakitu in a Pipe. Lakitus in a Pipe emerge similarly to Piranha Plants, which includes not emerging if the player character is standing on their pipe. A Lakitu in a Pipe throws only one Spiny Egg before retreating. Lakitus in a Pipe are defeated using the methods as Lakitus, but with the addition of being eaten by Yoshi.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario 64 and its remake. They are encountered in Tiny-Huge Island and Rainbow Ride, as well as one in Goomboss Battle and two in Sunshine Isles in the remake only. The first Lakitus encountered are the friendly Lakitu Bros., who represent the game camera, provide occasional hints, and film the entirety of the journey. The enemy Lakitus float around in wide, fast circles, and they start attacking Mario by dropping Spiny bombs upon sighting him. A Lakitu releases five coins when defeated. In the remake, Lakitus follow the player character more steadily and travel in a small circle slowly if they do not see them. If a Lakitu is swallowed and spit out by Yoshi before becoming an egg, it moves constantly in the direction it was spit, but unlike most enemies, the Lakitu manages to recover.

Lakitus appear in New Super Mario Bros. They are encountered in World 2-2 and World 6-A. A Lakitu named Lakithunder is the boss of World 7, and it attacks by striking bolts of lightning from a lightning cloud. A Lakitu is worth 1,000 points when defeated. If the Lakitu is defeated by a projectile, the player character can ride its cloud temporarily, like in Super Mario World.

Lakitus appear in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. They received a larger-eyed design differing from their design introduced in Mario Party 4. They are encountered in World 2-5, World 4-5, and the Enemy Courses of World 7. A Lakitu has its cloud left behind, even if defeated by a stomp. There are Lakitus that throw coins, and they are spawned from square clouds.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario Galaxy 2. They are encountered in Yoshi Star Galaxy and Starshine Beach Galaxy only. A Lakitu named King Lakitu is the boss of the former galaxy. A Lakitu can be knocked out of its cloud by Yoshi, leaving it in a temporary vulnerable state, if either a Spiny Egg is spit at it or the cloud is eaten. A Lakitu can be stunned if hit by a Star Bit, but for a shorter duration than most enemies. While on the ground, Lakitu is defeated if the player character touches it. Lakitu comes back shortly after being defeated, and if it is on the ground, Lakitu creates a replacement cloud if it is not defeated on time. Lakitus release coins or Star Bits the first three times they are defeated.

Lakitus appear in New Super Mario Bros. 2. They are similar as before. Going through a Gold Ring changes them into Gold Lakitus, which throw coins instead of Spiny Eggs; they become Lakitus again once the effects of the ring expire.

Lakitus appear in New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Luigi U, and their port. They are encountered in Blooming Lakitus, Seesaw Shrooms, and Lakitu! Lakitu! Lakitu! in New Super Mario Bros. U and in Spinning Sandstones, Beanstalk Jungle, and Cloudy Capers in New Super Luigi U. They are unchanged from New Super Mario Bros. Wii. There are Lakitus that throw Piranha Pods in Blooming Lakitus only.

Lakitus are course elements in Super Mario Maker, Super Mario Maker for Nintendo 3DS, and Super Mario Maker 2. They are available in every style except Super Mario 3D World in the latter game. A Lakitu can lose its cloud in any of the styles, regardless of how it was defeated. Lakitus fly up and down if wings are placed on them. Lakitus can have a different enemy or object placed on it to throw it instead, and shaking the enemy removes the Lakitu from its cloud.

Lakitu appear in Super Mario Run. They behave broadly similarly to their appearance in Super Mario Bros. Lakitu flies higher briefly if the player character enters the top portion of the screen. If the player gets too close after that, they can fly slightly higher than that to stay safe, though lower back to the normal flee range once the player leaves. They do not leave behind a Lakitu's Cloud when defeated. Lakitu in World Tour never leave, while Lakitu in Toad Rally will leave at the end of a segment and Lakitu in Remix 10 will leave toward the end of a course. 
The Lakitus in Big Spiny Blitz only throw a single coin per interval, which is affected by gravity. The Lakitus in Lakitu's Revenge throw both Spiny Eggs and coins, but always throws Spiny Eggs far to the right of the player.

Lakitus are non-playable characters in Super Mario Odyssey. One appears in the Desert Oasis of the Sand Kingdom; the Courtyard of the Lake Kingdom; the southeastern area of Snow Kingdom; and Beneath the Keep of Bowser's Kingdom. They can be captured, but mainly after every main story Power Moons has been collected for a kingdom, due to conditions like how the Lakitu of the Sand Kingdom is frozen beforehand. Every captured Lakitu can float around in a small area. It can fish for Cheep Cheeps in the water (or poison in Bowser's Kingdom), most giving coins when reeled in. The biggest Cheep Cheep of the Lake Kingdom and Snow Kingdom gives a Power Moon instead. The captured Lakitu in the Sand Kingdom can fish Captain Toad out of sand and for Poochy in Bowser's Kingdom, each for a Power Moon. A Lakitu which is not captured sings about fishing, but complains if an enemy is nearby.

Lakitus appear in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. They use their design from Mario Party 4, like in New Super Mario Bros. A trio of Lakitus in one cloud appears in Cruising with Linking Lifts, during its Wonder Effect, and Shining Falls Special Triple Threat Deluge; they throw coins, Wonder Tokens, and 1-Up Mushrooms.

Lakitus are enemies in the Super Mario Bros.: Peach-hime KyÅ«shutsu Dai Sakusen!. They resemble their in-game counterparts, but their clouds have no faces, except for two in the ending credits. Many Lakitus appear during the Koopa Troop invasion of the Mario Bros.' home. After this, no Lakitus are given major roles until shortly after Mario and Luigi had collected the Super Mushroom. The Mario Bros. are eventually attacked by a Lakitu, who explains that he wanted lure Mario and Luigi into his Piranha Plant garden in order to feed his plants, and that they will pay for having destroyed his garden. He traps Luigi amongst a horde of big-sized Spinies, although Mario manages to escape his eggs. A beanstalk appears and boosts Mario to Lakitu's height. The amused Lakitu then scoffs at Mario and shakes his hand before realizing that it is adjacent to his enemy. Though he attempts to escape, Mario manages to take the cloud, which he tampers with until he accidentally destroys the Spinies, saving Luigi.

Only one Lakitu (also spelled Lakatu) appears in the episode of The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!: "Mario and the Red Baron Koopa." It has the appearance of a green, more-reptilian turtle with a large nose, resembling generic Koopa Troopas in the cartoon, who wears a red-lensed, gold-framed aviator's goggles. King Koopa (using a magic carpet he has stolen from Sam Shalam) brings Lakitu to the country of Pastaland, where he scares the citizens, as well as Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool, and Toad, with Spinies and rain. Lakitu launches the Wicked Weather Satellite with King Koopa, and both of them relax atop Lakitu's cloud until it is destroyed. Lakitu last attempts to maintain its cloud, after the Mario Brothers' biplane had destroyed it. Its name is pronounced "la-KEE-too" by King Koopa and Princess Toadstool.
Koopa seemed to treat Lakitu more like a friend than a servant, as Koopa never once insulted Lakitu or got mad at him.

Lakitu appears in the episode of "Life's Ruff" of The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. It has beak much like regular Koopas and rides a storm cloud. The Lakitu has no lines. It only throws some explosive Spiny Eggs at Luigi to obstruct him in his chase with Hip and Hop Koopa.

Lakitu appears in the comic "Cloud Burst" of Nintendo Comics System. It is depicted very similarly as in game, except it rides a Lakitu's Cloud named Fluffy and sports a shell that is white, black, blue, and yellow in color instead of green and white. The Lakitu steals most items it finds, including Koopabits as well as its king's crown and Princess Toadstool's. Lakitu is ordered by the Kong to attack Mario and Luigi, though when the latter is sprung into Lakitu's cloud, a limited friendship seemed to have developed between both of them. Though Lakitu takes Luigi's clothing, he played along, being mostly interested in retrieving Princess Toadstool's crown for her coronation.

Lakitu appears only in the comic "Mario will hoch hinaus" of Club Nintendo. It is in the opening panel, watching Mario fly in surprise.

Lakitus have a variety of roles in Super Mario-kun, including enemies in certain issues and both a referee and an announcer in various Mario Kart tracks. The latter type bonks Mario with the traffic light in one strip.

Lakitus are antagonists in Super Mario Adventures. They briefly attack Princess Toadstool and her Toads with Spiny Eggs. These Lakitus appear in an unknown desert area where Princess Toadstool's troopers are dehydrating; when the gang of Toads first see a Lakitu's Cloud appear, they mistake it for a harmless raincloud and initiate a rain dance to ensure water. However, when they see that their actions had only provoked the Lakitus, they declare that they had "done the wrong dance" and chaos ensues. After this brief appearance, it is later revealed that Bowser had kidnapped Princess Toadstool and therefore, it can be assumed that the Lakitus captured her and her gang. Later, during Bowser and the princess's wedding, a Lakitu can be seen tossing confetti.

A Fishin' Lakitu appears throughout the Mario Kart series and takes on many responsibilities, guiding the race most of the time. He most prominently appears as the referee.

Lakitus are lastly encountered in the corridors of Bowser's Keep and use quick attacks in battle.
Lakitus are also friendly non-playable characters. The Lakitu in Tadpole Pond is a helper of Frog Sage, carrying him across the lake to give the illusion that he can float in midair (ruined briefly when the Lakitu lowers before recovering shortly after); the same Lakitu is present when Frog Sage admits to Mallow that he is not a tadpole. A huge, mustachioed Lakitu operates a bus to transport the party from Nimbus Land to Bowser's Keep.

Lakitus appear in Super Paper Mario. They are encountered in areas such as the Dotwood Tree and Overthere Stair; however, the aforementioned Laki character from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is given a reference in some Merlee's Mansion graffiti in this game and a Lakitu (despite his species's obscurity in Super Paper Mario) can appear as one of the randomly-generated characters on the first page of the Japanese Super Paper Mario website. The Lakitu Catch Card in Super Paper Mario states Lakitu's motives for throwing Spiny Eggs at opponents: Lakitu's actions are because someone "made fun of its glasses". It's implied that Laki wrote graffiti on the wall of Merlee's Basement.

A Lakitu appears in Paper Mario: Sticker Star. It is encountered on Whammino Mountain only. It retains the appearance of Lakitus in Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.

Lakitu is mentioned in Paper Mario: Color Splash by Luigi while the characters drive across the Rainbow Road to Black Bowser's Castle.

Lakitus appear in a minor role in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake. They were given a variant, Lakipea, which throws Sharpeas to attack. A Fishin' Lakitu with a red shell appears every time a Mario Brother levels up, carrying a selecting device that allows the player choose which stat they wish to add bonus points to (on top of the normal points gained while leveling up). Once selected, the device then flips over and becomes a roulette that determines how many points that stat earns, from one to three. Lakitus appear before the final battle with Fawful, with two holding up spotlights to reveal Fawful's cloakless form.

Lakitu plays a larger role in Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser. One serves as the sidekick and adviser to Captain Goomba and his squad, often scouting for minions and lost soldiers during his quest to rally Bowser's army and rescue their king. He first appears in the Beanbean Kingdom, when Captain Goomba and Captain Shy Guy are ready to take on the brainwashed Larry Koopa and his minions; he diverts them to a hidden place in the outskirts of the castle town and explains what he is up to. Lakitus also appear as units in the missions A Cloudy Day, Chain Chomp and Spike Stomp, Pokey Panic, Rumble in the Castle!, Goomba's Worth and The Mightiest Minions. Their special attack is Chain Stomp, which allows them to stomp on an enemy twice. They are strong against Sharpeas and Spinies, and weak against Shy Guys.

Lakitus are supporting characters in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. One assists in leveling up once more. A Lakitu with a camera also goes to Peach's Castle presumably to report on the launch of Professor Elvin Gadd's Time Machine towards the beginning of the game; when Toadsworth's fainting faces Mario with the challenge of retrieving a Refreshroom from the elderly Toad's room, this friendly Lakitu reporter (possibly one of the Lakitu Bros.) helps by providing a "cloud-cam view" of the castle, actually the bird's-eye map that Mario, Luigi, and their baby selves continue to use throughout the rest of their adventure. The Lakitu then flies off and is never seen again; as a matter of fact, the only other generic Lakitu seen in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time is an unnamed agent of Lakitu Travel who transports Kylie Koopa and Toadbert to the Star Shrine right before the battle with Elder Shrooboid. However, another Lakitu sub-species can be fought in the Vim Factory; these Shroob-like Lakitus, the Lakitufos, fly on UFOs rather than clouds, have antennae, and beam down Spiny Shroopas rather than throwing Spinies.

Lakitus are enemies in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. They are encountered in Dreamy Driftwood Shore. Outside of battle, Lakitus can either swoop down to run into Mario, or they can throw a Spiny Egg, causing a Spiny to appear when it hits the ground. Lakitus do not appear while leveling up, unlike before.
In battle, they appear in the background. Lakitu throw Spiny Eggs (or Mushrooms on rare occasion) in battle, either landing on Mario's head or sending them across the ground and into Mario. The Spiny Eggs can be hit back with the hammer, which damages the Lakitu. After this attack, Spinies will enter the battle. When a Taunt Ball is used on a Lakitu, it will attack immediately.
Two new species of Lakitus also appear: Lakitu Rs, a stronger version of Lakitu in Dreamy Neo Bowser Castle, and Commander Lakitus, which appear in Somnom Woods and appear groups of two and fight in the background by ordering certain attacks to Boomerang Bros.

Lakitus are non-playable characters in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. They host the Lakitu Info Center.
