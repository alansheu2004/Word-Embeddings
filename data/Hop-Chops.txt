Hop-Chops (formerly singularized Hop-Chop) are enemies in Super Mario 3D World, its port, and Super Mario Maker 2. They are sentient green springboards with a square head, red eyes, and sharp teeth. Their name is a portmanteau of "hop" and the phrase "chop-chop". These enemies usually appear in groups of three or more, and reside in areas where a springboard is required to obtain a collectible, such as a Green Star.

Hop-Chops are enemies first appearing in Super Mario 3D World. They are usually encountered in groups. When players approach a Hop-Chop, it will begin to bounce toward them. Hop-Chops can be defeated by any attack. Some Hop-Chops react slower than others; these ones turn into springboards when defeated, which the player can then carry and use. Usually, one Hop-Chop per group can turn into a springboard. If left as a springboard for too long, it will turn back into a Hop-Chop. This can also happen while it is carried.

Hop-Chops (singularized Hop-Chops for the first time) are enemies in Super Mario Maker 2. They can be placed in the Super Mario 3D World style only. Hop-Chops are no longer are defeated when jumped on, instead acting like Trampolines initially. Hop-Chops with wings jump and hover above the ground before dropping back down.
