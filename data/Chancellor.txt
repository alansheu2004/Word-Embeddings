The chancellor (or Chancellor) is an advisor to Princess Peach. He is an older, green-spotted Mushroom person. In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake, the chancellor assumes the princess's duties during her absence. He is also overprotective of the princess, and he forbids her from joining Mario in his quest to defeat Smithy. The chancellor's appearance and actions suggest that he is an earlier counterpart of Toadsworth.
Early in the game, the chancellor gives Mario a map of the world. He also authorizes Mario to stock up on items in the Mushroom Castle's vault, which is protected by the Vault Guard. Additionally, the chancellor is easily frightened (like many other Mushroom People). He is scared of Mario's impersonation of Bowser, and during the Smithy Gang's invasion of the Mushroom Kingdom, the chancellor hides behind a column in the throne room during the entire occupation. He is also forgetful at times.

In Paper Mario, a character known as the Toad Minister or simply the Minister makes an appearance. His color palette is slightly different, noticeably having a white mustache and red robe instead of a black mustache and green robe. While it is unknown if they are intended to be the same individual, the Minister nonetheless takes the place of the chancellor from the previous RPG and serves a nearly identical role as a high-ranking government official. The Minister is imprisoned along with other Toads after Bowser seizes Peach's Castle. Mario meets the prisoners when he storms Bowser's Castle later in the game, and he frees them when Bowser is defeated.

Goombario can use Tattle on the Toad Minister after Mario unlocks a cell in which the Minister is imprisoned.
