The Safety Glider is an High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It is a variant of the Super Glider with a yellow-and-black toned barricade pattern and the text "Safety First" in both English and Japanese emblazoned on the sailcloth. It is the signature glider of Builder Mario, Builder Luigi, Builder Toadette and Builder Toad. Unlike the Super Glider, the Safety Glider improves the chances of obtaining Bob-ombs from Item Boxes and increases the number of points awarded for hitting other drivers with them.
The glider had been made obtainable during the 2020 Trick Tour and was part of the first week's spotlight, alongside Builder Mario and the Dozer Dasher.
