Sand Geysers are pillars of sand that rise up out of bottomless pits. They can temporarily help the player cross gaps and reach elevated areas. If Mario jumps into one, he is carried up to the top of the geyser by its force. They appear in New Super Mario Bros. Wii and New Super Mario Bros. U, in World 2-1 and World 2-5, and Spike's Spouting Sands and Blooming Lakitus respectively, as one of the main elements of the levels. They also appear in the World 2 map, between World 2-5 and the Spiny Enemy Course. Additionally, Sand Geysers also appear in the World Coin-4 in Coin Battle mode. They have the same functions of Water Geysers that appear in New Super Mario Bros. U.
In Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Sand Geysers are found in World 2-1 and World 2-3. One appears in the former, in the underground area containing the first Tablet Piece to get Mario back to the surface. Multiple of them are featured in the latter, serving the same purpose as in World 2-1, this time to let him attempt another slide down the ruins.
A single Sand Geyser also appears in Mario Kart 8 and its Nintendo Switch port, in the course Bone-Dry Dunes. It appears before the cave section, constantly rising above the quicksand separating the two parts of the track. It can be used to propel the racer to the wooden bridge that goes above the normal path. 
Sand Geysers appear in Super Mario Odyssey, where they can be found in the Tostarena Ruins area of the Sand Kingdom.
