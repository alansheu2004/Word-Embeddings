Chaindeliers (originally known as Kinklinks) are a variety of Chain Chomps that are used to hold up chandeliers in Bowser's Keep. Their name is a portmanteau of "Chain Chomp" and "chandelier." In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake, Mario and Bowser fight on a pair of chandeliers, each one held up by a Chaindelier. Bowser proves too difficult to defeat, so Mario (with some advice from Princess Peach) attacks the Chaindelier holding up Bowser's chandelier instead. After it is defeated, the screen flashes white as, with an exception of the Switch version, the fire in the chandeliers' candles goes out. The Chaindelier then drops the chandelier along with Bowser. However, as he falls, he starts to throw hammers at Mario's Chaindelier. Eventually, the second Chaindelier drops Mario, sending him plummeting to the ground below, though he manages to get back up by jumping on Bowser.
During the battle with Boomer, who is also fought on the chandeliers, the Chaindeliers are replaced with Shyndeliers.
In the English localization only, the Chomp Shell is said to be the shell of a Kinklink, while Orb Users' thought states that they hate Kinklinks. However, this appears to be an error on the translation's part, as in the original Japanese text, the more geographically appropriate Chomp is used in both instances. This may have been overcorrection due to a line earlier in the game, when Bowser addresses his Kinklink as Chomp in the Japanese version.
