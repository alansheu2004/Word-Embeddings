Precision Gliding is a type of bonus challenge in Mario Kart Tour introduced in the Battle Tour. The objective in these type of bonus challenges is to steer into targets while gliding and landing near the middle of the large target near the ground, with upwards and downwards wind typically preventing the player in achieving the goal.
When gliding through the wooden targets in the air, players can earn 100 points for gliding through the center, 50 for gliding through the white ring, or 30 for gliding through the blue ring. For the large target, players can earn 500 points for landing at the center (pink circle with a yellow star), 400 for the orange ring, 300 for the yellow ring, 200 for the green ring, or 100 for the blue ring. Players can also earn 0 points for missing any of the targets completely.
It is tied with Ready, Set, Rocket Start as the least recurring bonus challenge, with only 3 different challenges.
