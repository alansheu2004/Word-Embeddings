Doopliss's parrot is a bird found in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. He lives in the westernmost room beneath the Creepy Steeple.
The parrot plays a role in Chapter 4 of the game, where Mario with Vivian must know Doopliss's name in order to regain his body. He heads back to the Creepy Steeple, where Doopliss lives. Going to the bottom of a well, Mario and Vivian manage to find a secret passage to a hidden room. Inside, they find the parrot; at first, the parrot feigns ignorance, simply saying random things such as wanting crackers, or even a phrase about getting a Shine Sprite, referencing Super Mario Sunshine. However, if Mario uses Vivian's Veil ability, the parrot speaks. At first, the parrot only complains about his predicament of being locked in a room, but after some ranting, he finally yells out the name of his captor, Doopliss. After hearing this, Mario and Vivian spring from the shadows and leave the room. They have to take the letter "p" in the room to spell Doopliss's name, however.
After Doopliss abandons the Creepy Steeple, he leaves the parrot in his room. If Mario and his partners visit the parrot after Chapter 4, the parrot speaks to the player normally (complaining about Doopliss leaving him there alone), and nothing happens if the player uses Veil in the room.

In the original game, Goombella gives the Tattle of the room if Mario stands next to the parrot, though there is unused text for the parrot's Tattle. This Tattle is used in the Nintendo Switch remake.
