The Feather is an accessory in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. It increases speed by 20 points, as well as both physical and magical defense by five. The Feather is dropped by Dodo on his way out of Valentina's statue room if Mario successfully avoids being caught by him as he pecks the statues. In-game, it appears as a black, white, and red feather, though its artwork depicts it as a Native American-style headband. It can be sold for 333 coins, but cannot be replaced. In the remake, a second Feather can be purchased from the Miner's Store in the Moleville item shop for 250 coins.
