The Science Claw is an item of machinery appearing in Paper Mario: Color Splash. It is owned by the Green Energy Plant researcher, who houses it in the Green Energy Plant, where he does research and occasionally plays with it. When Huey attempts to enter the plant, the Toad suddenly pulls him. However, when Mario enters, Huey is in the claw's grip, which is attempting to drain his power. The Toad reassures Huey before introducing himself. After his explanation, Mario must pull Huey out of the claw's grip, which he is noticeably angry about.
If Mario speaks to the researcher, he informs him that he longs to do research while admitting that he wants to play with his Science Claw. Interestingly, however, the claw seems to disappear after the electricity is restored and the plant is re-entered, with the Toad and his chair now in its position.
During the interlude/dance celebration following the return of the green Big Paint Star, the researcher appears in the plaza, moonwalking next to the stand with his Science Claw.
