Pestnuts are round plant-like enemies that appear in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. They are found rolling on the ground in Chucklehuck Woods, and they often camouflage themselves as brown Chuckola Fruit to drop from their trees and attack anyone walking nearby. Pestnuts appear as round and orange chestnut-like creatures with green spikes. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, they are more circular, the spikes are thicker, and the placement of the spikes are similar to an Urchin, particularly the six spikes around the face. The Chuckola Fruit they camouflage as in the world are now bright orange with yellow "teeth".
A stronger variety of Pestnuts called Elite Pestnuts appear in the Seabed.

Pestnuts attack by rolling into their target from the front or from behind. The former can be countered with Mario or Luigi's hammer, whereas the latter can be dodged by jumping. The Pestnut's spikes make them impossible to jump on unless Mario or Luigi wear one of the "Spiny-Killer Jump" badges; in the original game, jumping on Pestnuts to counter-attack will still damage the Bros. even if they are wearing one. After the Pestnut takes enough damage, its outer shell will break, revealing either a Beanie or Gold Beanie underneath, which will then continue to fight.
Pestnuts also appear as enemies in Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser. They are melee troopers, and attack by rolling into their opponents. Their Special Skill is Spin to Win, allowing them to roll into a minion three times. Due to their spikes, attacking a Pestnut from the side or above causes damage to the minion. Pestnuts are weak against Spear Guys. A group of Pestnuts appears as part of Private Goomp's squad of Goombas in Chucklehuck Woods, suggesting a relation.

Due to how they function in battle, Pestnuts are the only non-boss enemies in the game that cannot be defeated in a single attack.
