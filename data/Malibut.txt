A Malibut is an octopus enemy encountered in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. Its name is a portmanteau of "mal-" (the Latin root word for "bad") and "halibut". Malibuts appear only in battle alongside Cheep Cheeps (Spiny Cheep Cheeps in the remake), Mecha-Bloopers, and Starkisses on the Seabed. Malibuts appear to be constantly sleeping, wearing sleep masks and lying on top of a pillow; a snot bubble can be seen coming from the general area where the nose would be.

Malibuts can shoot small yellow-green pearls (bubbles in the remake) from their tentacles toward Mario and Luigi, which can be jumped on or over. A Malibut may also roll over before producing a large bubble, which floats towards one of the Bros. and must be countered with a hammer; the bubble may render Mario or Luigi dizzy if it hits. When struck with any attack, an ! appears as the Malibut wakes up, with the snot bubble popping, and it retaliates by throwing one or two pillows at the offender. These pillows must be hammered away to avoid damage; in the remake, countering the pillows will send them back towards the Malibut and damage it.
