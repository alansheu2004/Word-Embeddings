Rainbow Starchute is a High-End glider that appears in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the Vancouver Tour, it is the signature glider of Wario (Hiker), Wario (Cowboy) and Builder Mario. The glider is a variant of the Starchute that resembles the Rainbow Star from Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 but with eyes. Unlike the Starchute, the Rainbow Starchute improves the chances of getting Mega Mushrooms from Item Boxes and yields more points for crashing drivers while under the effects of a Mega Mushroom.

In the first week of Mario vs. Luigi Tour (2022), Rainbow Starchute appeared in the Tier Shop. It could be obtained in exchange for 10,000 Coins.
Starting in the Battle Tour, Rainbow Starchute appears in pipes and has become a part of the Daily Selects lineup.
