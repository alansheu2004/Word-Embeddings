Sugarloaf Mountain (in Portuguese: Pão de Açúcar) is a peak at the bay of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

During the events of the PC and SNES versions of Mario is Missing!, Luigi finds a cable car that was stolen from Sugarloaf Mountain (formatted as Sugar Loaf Mountain) by Koopas. The cable car is needed to get visitors to the top of the mountain. Before returning the cable car to Sugar Loaf Mountain's Curator, Luigi has to correctly answer some questions to prove its authenticity. Upon delivering it back, Luigi is rewarded a prize of 2,250 dollars.

The pamphlet wrongly states that Sugar Loaf Mountain is 1300 meters high; the correct measure would be 1300 feet, which is only about 400 meters.

In the Wii U version of Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, Sugarloaf Mountain is depicted in one of the game's Stamps.
In the Nintendo 3DS version, Sugarloaf Mountain is one of the areas explorable in Copacabana in the Road to Rio mode. The player can take the tramway to the top to find a chest containing a melon. On Day 2 of Mario Story, the player is tasked by Princess Daisy to investigate ghost sightings around Copacabana, including on Sugarloaf Mountain. At the mountain's base, a townsperson tells the player that they saw a ghost on top of it, and the player and the townsperson head to the top, where they find the Mysterious Map before heading back down.
