The Creepy Dice Block, formerly known as the Cursed Dice Block, is a special Dice Block in the Mario Party series that reduces the number of spaces a player can advance on a board.

The item debuts in Mario Party: Star Rush, appearing in World 2-2 and World 2-3. Here, it comes from obtaining a false duplicate of a character on the map in Toad Scramble, which is actually a Peepa in disguise. The Peepa then curses the party with a Dice Block that either does nothing (0) or subtracts  (-1) from the player's total roll. The Peepa cannot be selected, and it eventually disappears after a set period of time.

A similar Dice Block, called Dicey Dice Block, appears in Super Mario Party, albeit with a few differences: it is rolled by a Bob-omb instead of a Peepa, and it has three faces with the number 0 and three with the number -1, instead of having two of the former and four of the latter.

The Cursed Dice Block returns in Mario Party Superstars as an item. In this game, it functions almost identically to the Poison Mushroom from Mario Party 3. When used, the player is allowed to choose a single player as their target (including themselves). The target of the Cursed Dice Block has their potential roll reduced to 1 to 3 the next time they roll the Dice Block, much to their dismay while the character who targeted the player laughs. Players can break the curse by using a Mushroom, Double Dice, Triple Dice, or Custom Dice Block. On Yoshi's Tropical Island and Peach's Birthday Cake, Bowser will sometimes sell a Cursed Dice Block to any player that passes him at a price much higher than the price of 3 coins it sells for at the shop.

The Cursed Dice Block, renamed the Creepy Dice Block, returns in Super Mario Party Jamboree, functioning identically to how it does in Mario Party Superstars. It is commonly found within Kamek's shops, but never Koopa Troopa's shops. It also has two variants that are more potent, the Creepy Dice Block Tickets and the Super Creepy Dice.
