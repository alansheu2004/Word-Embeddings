Dropdown Countdown Lifts are semisolid yellow platforms that are featured in the level Countdown to Drop Down in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. They vary in width, and some of them are found moving on tracks. These platforms show a number from 1-10; this number will decrease when a player or object lands on them. When the counter reaches one, the platform turns red. Once it reaches zero, the color goes to a dark gray and the platform gives out and starts spinning in a manner reminiscent of a Rotating Block, which causes anything on top of it to fall through. It will return back to its original state a few seconds after this. If a Dropdown Countdown Lift is left alone after it is stepped on, but before its number reaches zero, it will start quickly counting back up to its original value.
Dropdown Countdown Lifts are strongly reminiscent of Countdown Platforms from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, another semisolid platform which counts down how many times the player can step on it. They function slightly differently, however, as Dropdown Countdown Lifts will count down when the player steps on them, while Countdown Platforms will not do so until Yoshi steps off of them.
