Goomba Takedown (known as Beat Up Goombas in the closed beta) is a type of bonus challenge in Mario Kart Tour. The goal in these bonus challenges is to take out a certain number of Goombas in a course before reaching the finish line. Goombas can appear individually or in stacks, and can be knocked out by interacting with them in any way, including using items from Item Boxes, detonating nearby Barrel Bombs, landing on top of them, or simply driving into them. During a Goomba Takedown challenge, courses may feature elements that are not normally found in them, such as the aforementioned Barrel Bombs, Item Boxes that only give a certain item, platforms for Goombas to stand on, or additional ramps that enable the driver to land on Goombas.
