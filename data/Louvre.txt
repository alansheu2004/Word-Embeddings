The Louvre is a famous museum located in Paris, France. 

In The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3, it first appears in "7 Continents for 7 Koopas". Having ordered each of his kids to take over one of the Real World's seven continents, Bowser orders Kootie Pie Koopa to wreck havoc in Europe. Kootie Pie complies by heading to the Louvre, where she transforms all of the artwork into portraits of herself. Those that are shown are:

Later on, Mario comes by to steal Kootie Pie's magic wand, and uses it to restore all of the original artwork. He also creates a wave of water from the Birth of Kootie, which washes Kootie Pie out of the Louvre.
The Louvre also briefly appears in the episode "Super Koopa". Bowser invites his kids to run amok in Paris, so Hip and Hop travel to the Louvre, where they employ Paragoombas to remove many of the original paintings. Hop is seen putting up some of his own so-called "masterpieces", while Hip is seen vandalizing the Mona Lisa.
Although Hip and Hop eventually leave the Louvre, it is never shown as to how the original artwork is restored to the museum.

The Louvre also appears in the DOS and Deluxe versions of Mario is Missing!, during which the Mona Lisa gets stolen by Koopa Troopas after they invade Paris. Luigi eventually reobtains the painting and, after answering some questions to prove that it is genuine, the Louvre is reopened to the public. Despite what its image shows, the glass pyramid in front of the Louvre is not red and does not display a giant picture of the Mona Lisa.

The Louvre makes a small cameo in Mario Kart Tour's course Paris Promenade, where it can be seen from the roundabout furthest from the finish line. Unusually, it is not present in the course's reappearance in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
