A Carroboscis is a floating carrot-like creature in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. The name is a portmanteau of "carrot" and "proboscis," likely referring to their long pointed noses. These enemies reside in Booster Pass, the entryway to Booster Tower. Although fairly strong, Carroboscis only aid other enemies, such as the Spikester, in battle; Carroboscis never fight on their own. In a fight, a Carroboscis will jump towards the opponent and flash its green eyes, causing damage. A Carroboscis can also summon magical bells to attack intruders with musical spells while using Doom Reverb, Spore Chimes, and Scarecrow Bell.
A white variant based on daikons, named Radish, was originally going to appear in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, but was cut from the game. It also had the same health points as Carroboscis, with the exception of lacking magic attacks.
