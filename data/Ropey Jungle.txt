Ropey Jungle is the first level of Jiggle Jungle in Wario Land: Shake It!

As the level's name says, Ropey Jungle has many ropes and vines in which the player can climb on to get over rivers and obstacles around the jungle. Another part of the level is around many Venus Guytraps that can trap Wario if he stands on them too long. Fortunately, Wario can jump on them to access areas that he is unable to reach, allowing him to get treasure. Later in the level, the player will come up to even more ropes to climb on, including ones that Wario can slide place-to-place on. In this area, there will also be purple Venus Guytraps that can catch Wario the instant Wario stands on them. The player can also use these to reach higher ledges and get to the caged Merfle. When freeing the Merfle, an alarm will go off and Wario will need to run to the end of the level before the clock hits zero.
