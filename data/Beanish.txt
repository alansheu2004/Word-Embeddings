The Beanish are the occupants of the Beanbean Kingdom and a species in the Mario & Luigi series. They first appear in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. The Beanish people are of the Beanbean Kingdom as Toads are of the Mushroom Kingdom. Beanish have green skin, with some having huge mouths, and are generally quick to laughter. The Beanish may be able to live for many, many years, as is evidenced by the fact that Bubbles spent one thousand years pleasing the Chuckola Reserve. The Beanish are more protective of their borders than the Toads, and their government seems less aloof than that of the Mushroom Kingdom, as seen by the Beanbean posts in Hoohoo Village.
Fawful is the only Beanish character in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, where he is a shopkeeper, and in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, where he is the main antagonist.
The Hoohooligans and Clumphs are related species, but feature noticeably different physiology compared to typical Beanish. There is also a Beanish-like pet species called Beanlets, as well as an unnamed green dog seen accompanying an unnamed Beanish miner on Hoohoo Mountain. The Beanish may be related to the ancient Soybean civilization.

Beanish people, as well as Popple, return in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. They are seen around Pi'illo Island. Many of them are on vacation, traveling from the Beanbean Kingdom.
The characters Podley and Podler from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door are comparable to the Beanish people.
