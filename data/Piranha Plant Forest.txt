Piranha Plant Forest is a court in Mario Tennis Aces. It features Biddybuds as line judges and a Pink Yoshi sitting on a tree stump as the court's referee, as well as various Yoshis, Toads, Rabbits and a Goomba as spectators. The court's gimmick is three Warp Pipes with Piranha Plants that are located in the middle; the Piranha Plants go in and out of the pipes, and if a ball comes their way, they swallow it and spit it out on the opposite side of the court. Fire Piranha Plants (which have their Super Mario 3D Land color scheme) can also appear; if one catches a ball, it will fire a Zone Shot.

In Adventure Mode, Piranha Plant Forest is the second area visited. Mario and Toad come here searching for the first Power Stone. Upon arriving at the forest, Donkey Kong tells Mario and Toad that the forest is dangerous, and if they want to enter they need to show their tennis skills first by beating him. After that, Mario needs to defeat a horde of Piranha Plants by hitting them with their own fireballs. To obtain the Power Stone here, Mario must defeat Petey Piranha. This area also has two optional missions; one where Mario practices with Toad by rallying the ball until he reaches 200 points, and another one where Mario needs to hit the ball 20 times without missing or letting Spike hit it. Completing Spike's mission rewards Mario with the Wooden Racket.
