The Minion Paper Glider is a Normal glider in Mario Kart Tour. It is a variant of the Paper Glider introduced in the 2019 Winter Tour with a design featuring Bloopers, Bob-ombs, Boos, Bullet Bills, Chain Chomps, Cheep Cheeps, Goombas, and Piranha Plants on a blue background. Unlike the Paper Glider, this glider provides better chances of obtaining Bloopers from Item Boxes and increases the number of points earned for hitting other drivers with Bloopers.

The Minion Paper Glider has been obtainable from regular pipes since its debut, and has been part of the Daily Selects lineup since the 2022 Mii Tour. The following table shows its special availability by tour.
