Fire Drive is a badge in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. It is the reward for reaching the twentieth floor of the Pit of 100 Trials, can be bought from the Lovely Howz of Badges for 100 coins, and is rarely dropped after battle by Koopatrols, Lava Bubbles, Embers, and Phantom Embers. If Mario equips it, he is able to use a new hammer move called Fire Drive, which can be used for five FP. When it is used, Mario launches a fireball towards the enemies, dealing damage to every one on the ground. The first enemy is hurt for 5 damage, and every subsequent enemy is hurt for one less than the previous enemy. It also gives every damaged enemy the burn status effect, dealing one damage to them per turn until it wears off. Equipping multiple copies of the badge increases the moveâ€™s attack power by 2 and the FP required to perform it by 5 per additional badge.
