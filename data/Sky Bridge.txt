The Sky Bridge is the location of a minigame in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Run by a Shaman, it is the last area in the field section of Land's End. For the price of five coins, Mario can attempt one of three courses to cross a bridge of Donut Blocks while avoiding Bullet Bills. If he is successful, he earns a prize and has the two-time option to double it by retrying the course in a slightly harder phase, although failing a subsequent time makes Mario lose all current winnings. If he fails, the Shaman can bring him back up to the starting point and he is not rewarded. In their initial forms, the Normal course offers five coins, the Special course offers eight coins, and the Expert course offers a Frog Coin. In the Normal course, jumps are locked on to the Donut Blocks and they do not fall; in the Special course, the jumps are locked on to the Donut Blocks and they fall as usual; and in the Expert course, the jumps are not locked on to the Donut Blocks and they fall as usual.
