Africa is Earth's second-largest and second-most populous continent, after Asia in both cases. It first appeared in Super Mario-related media in The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.

In the Saturday Supercade episode "Hairy Parent", Donkey Kong visits the wilderness of an unspecified location in Africa to deliver a letter to a resident ape known as Momma.

In The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode "7 Continents for 7 Koopas," when Bowser tries to conquer the entire Real World, he puts Kooky von Koopa in charge of Africa. Kooky uses his magic wand to turn all of Africa's animals (including a lion, giraffe, zebra, gorilla, and an African elephant) into stuffed animals. Luigi later steals Kooky's wand and turns the stuffed animals back to normal. The animals then proceed to chase Kooky.

In the PC, SNES, and NES versions of Mario is Missing!, Luigi visits several cities in Africa on his quest to rescue Mario. The cities included vary depending on the version of the game.

While not appearing in gameplay, Africa, along with Earth's other continents, is featured on the online racing menus in the entries of the Mario Kart series that support online play, including Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 7, and Mario Kart 8 along with its remake Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

In the PC and SNES versions of Mario's Time Machine, Mario travels to Alexandria, Egypt in Africa, and in the NES version, he simply travels to Egypt.

Africa, specifically Egypt, is featured in the German Club Nintendo comic "Mario's Picross".

In Mario Party DS, Africa is included on the globe in the minigame Globe Gunners, with the Egyptian pyramids being featured as one of the many landmarks on the globe that the player battles on.
