A Whuhoh (originally known as a Hidon) is a Chewy that is disguised as a green treasure box in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. Its original name is a play on "hidden," referring to how its true form is enclosed within the chest until Mario strikes it from below and initiates the battle. The Whuhoh also shares its original English name with a boss in Final Fantasy VI, another game by Square. Unlike the other enemies found in treasure boxes in the game, a Whuhoh is encountered only once in the game. After defeating it, the player receives a large number of Experience Points and coins and can then find the Safety Badge inside the Whuhoh's now-vacant treasure box. While the Chewy is hidden, only eyes are visible, despite the fact that Piranha Plants do not possess eyes.
Like its lookalikes the Huhwhat, Pleaseno, and Comeon, a Whuhoh is a powerful opponent, having both high attack and defense, as well as high HP and immunity to Thunder, Fire, and Ice and all status ailments, although Mario's jump attacks are very effective. The Whuhoh's first action in battle is to release four Mini Goombas that are trapped inside the chest ("Monsters are inside!") to assist it in battle; once they are all defeated, it releases another set.
If a Whuhoh is targeted with a normal attack, it either attacks in return or uses Carni-Kiss, which allows it to bite a party member for twice the damage of its normal attack. The odds of each are 2/3 in favor of casting one of its normal attacks (Static Electricity, Will-O-Wisp, and Flame Stone) and 1/3 in favor of using Carni-Kiss.
