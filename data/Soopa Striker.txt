Soopa Strikers are a type of Koopa that appears in Super Paper Mario. They wear white soccer uniforms and black-and-white-checkered shells, reminiscent of a soccer ball, and have large, gray eyebrows. The "Soopa" in their name is derived from "super", spelled in a way that mimics "Koopa".
Soopa Strikers attack by placing a shell onto the ground and then kicking it at their opponents. Soopa Strikers are the second most powerful relatives of the Koopa Striker, second only to the Dark Striker, who are found in the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials. Soopa Strikers were used by Count Bleck to protect his castle and can also be found in the 69th room of the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials.
