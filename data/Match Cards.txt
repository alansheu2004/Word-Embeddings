Match Cards, also shortened to Match, is a Bonus Challenge which requires memorization in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and its remake, Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. The player will be shown fourteen cards at the start, and they will have to match them after. If the player makes one mistake, then the cards the player chose will get flipped over again. If the player makes two mistakes, then the player will lose this Bonus Challenge, but they will keep whatever was grabbed along the way. If the player chooses six pairs correctly, the last two will become two 10-Up Cards. In Yoshi's Island DS, each match is worth a 1-Up, and if successful, the player will earn a 16-Up for all seven matches. In the original game, it is the unlockable minigame of World 4, whereas in the sequel, it is in World 3.
