World 8-4 is the fourth level of World 8 in Super Mario 3D Land.

This level is a Ghost House level. The player starts on a staircase-like platform. Upon reaching the end, a section of platform begins moving along on its own. The platform later connects to another platform, which contains an unlit torch and several ? Blocks. Mario must then jump onto a Switchboard, while avoiding several small and large pushing walls, as well as three Tail Boos. The platform at the end of the Switchboard's path contains the Checkpoint Flag. The platform after this is circular and continuously spins around. In the center is a ? Block containing a Super Star, though five Boos (one being a Tail Boo) spawn as soon as it is hit. The next platform moves as soon as it is hit; the player must avoid several Peepas and Boos, as well as a Big Boo as it travels along. The platform's destination contains the door leading outside with another moving platform and the Goal Pole.
