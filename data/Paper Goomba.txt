Paper Goombas are paper forms of Goombas that appear as enemies in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. They are commonly found in Sunbeam Plains. A stack of Paper Goombas is fought in the area as a tutorial boss for Paper Mario. Another Paper Goomba is fought in Neo Bowser Castle alongside a regular Goomba, a Koopa Troopa and a Paper Koopa Troopa as one of Bowser's last lines of defense. Rare, shiny variants can also appear in place of the regular Paper Goombas in Sunbeam Plains. Stronger versions of a shiny Paper Goomba can also appear alongside Shiny RoboBowser during the final boss battle, which have even greater stats and will always drop a Max Mushroom upon defeat. One Paper Goomba pilots the Papercraft Megacrinkle Goomba.

Regular Paper Goombas attack by trying to walk into Mario, Luigi or Paper Mario, and can also jump up and floating down towards them. Both attacks can be dodged by jumping. The Paper Goomba stack fought in Sunbeam Plains has higher POW and DEF, and can attack by forming into a Goomba Wheel and ramming into Paper Mario. Shiny Paper Goombas have greater stats, though their methods of attack remain the same, and will always drop a Syrup Jar and 1-Up Mushroom when defeated.
