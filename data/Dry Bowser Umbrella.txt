The Dry Bowser Umbrella is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. First introduced in the New Year's 2021 Tour, it is a variant of the Oilpaper Umbrella that features the Undead Motors logo on it. As its name suggests, it is the signature glider of Dry Bowser. Unlike the Oilpaper Umbrella, hitting racers with Green Shells will award more points when using this glider.

The Dry Bowser Umbrella is available in all regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not included in the Daily Selects lineup. The table below lists the special availability of the glider.
