The Gold Fish Bone Ferry is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour that was introduced in the Night Tour. As the name suggests, it is a golden variant of the Fish Bone Ferry, including the tires (which are the same as the Gold Blooper's), and with glowing red eyes. Unlike the Fish Bone Ferry, this kart increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the number of points awarded for performing a Rocket Start.

The Gold Fish Bone Ferry is not currently obtainable from pipes and not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. However, it has been included in the Daily Spotlight lineup for every tour starting with the Vacation Tour. The following table shows its availability by tour.
