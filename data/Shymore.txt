Shymores, originally known as Shysters, are small artificial beings resembling Shy Guys that hop on sword-tipped pogo sticks named Shyhoppers in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. Their original name is a pun on "Shy Guy" and possibly "shyster," a slang term meaning "conman." The pun is altered in the remake to where it now references the sword type known as "claymore." Shymores attack by jumping on top of their opponents. Additionally, Shymores can use the weak attack Hot Shot to shoot a small fireball at opponents. Shymores can be easily defeated with lightning magic. During Mario and Mallow's battle with Claymorton, the boss summons four Shymore Bodyguards to aid him in the fight.
Shymores are soldiers that work for the Smithy Gang and seem to love nothing more than hopping around all day. During Claymorton's invasion of the Mushroom Kingdom, the Shymores terrorize the townsfolk.
After Mario's penultimate fight with Smithy, a Shymore, an Aero, and a Drill Bit ask Smithy to calm down and to stop slamming the floor with his mallet in order to prevent the Factory from falling apart, as the foundation was built only yesterday. Their efforts fail as Smithy continues to slam the foundation with his hammer, collapsing the floor and sending his minions flying away.
Several stronger varieties of Shymores exist, including the Springer and the Shyper, as well as the Machine Made version of Bodyguard.
