The Shielded Speedster is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2022 Mario vs. Luigi Tour and is the signature kart of Luigi (Knight). The kart is a silver vehicle that is based on knight armor and has a jousting lance on the right side of the vehicle and two more lances as the exhaust pipes, a knight helmet at the front, and a cape at the back. It uses the Iron Cucumber's tires and the emblem is located on a flag at the back of the kart.

The Shielded Speedster possesses two variants - one black and one gold - that both debuted in the 2023 Mario vs. Luigi Tour as High-End karts.
