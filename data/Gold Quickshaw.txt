The Gold Quickshaw is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2023 Winter Tour. As the name suggests, it is a gold variant of the Quickshaw, including the tires. Unlike the Quickshaw, this kart has an increased Mini-Turbo boost duration and awards more points for performing Mini-Turbos.

The Gold Quickshaw is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. However, it has been included in the Daily Spotlight lineup for every tour starting with the 2023 Mario Tour. The following table shows this kart's special availability by tour.
