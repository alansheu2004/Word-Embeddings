Bubble Wario is one of Wario's many reactions in the Wario Land series. To achieve this reaction, Wario must become trapped in a bubble by touching one when swimming underwater. Wario can then float upwards while ignoring the flow of a water current, which would otherwise force Wario to move in a certain direction. To return to normal, he must simply reach the water surface or hit a ceiling. 
In Wario Land 3, Bubble Wario appears as it did in the previous installment. In this game, after Wario acquires the Prince Frog's Glove powerup, allowing him to swim against currents, the benefits of this reaction become redundant, and thus it only functions as obstacles instead. Wolfenboss inflicts a unique variant of this reaction with his wisps if Wario is hit by it, with Wario turning orange and being levitated into the air and out of the arena by smaller light-blue bubbles that circle around him instead of one giant bubble, making the same pose as and spinning around like regular Bubble Wario.
Bubble Wario is also one of three Wario reactions appearing in Densetsu no Starfy 3, along with Flaming Wario and Puffy Wario in Wario's guest appearance in the Kaitei Iseki. Wario also becomes this form in the Wario Land 3 microgame from WarioWare Gold, where he has to be navigated between underwater spikes.
The Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 section of the Nintendo Character Manual used during the 1990s refers to Wario swimming underwater as Bubbles Wario, although this is not a reaction like Bubble Wario.
