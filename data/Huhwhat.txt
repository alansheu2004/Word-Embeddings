A Huhwhat (originally known as a Pandorite) is an enemy disguised as a treasure box that appears in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. The creature inside the chest appears to be either a squat, pudgy ghost or a mole of some sort. It is encountered in the Kero Sewers. Its original name comes from the name of the Greek legend of Pandora's box, a container that released the world's misfortunes when opened. In the remake, its new name of Huhwhat is a combination of the interjections "huh" and "what," while also staying true to its Japanese name.
A Huhwhat possesses both high physical attack and defense, and equally high magical attack and defense. It is immune to all special attacks, Mario's various jump attacks excepted. In battle, a Huhwhat can cast various fire spells, including Flame and Flame Wall. The creature inside the chest also uses the attack Scream, which can induce the Fear status ailment and Carni-Kiss, as well as physical strikes. Defeating Huhwhat rewards Mario's party with ten Experience Points, 30 coins, a Flower Jar, and the Trueform Pin. If Mario exits the room and reenters it at any point, the treasure box that previously held the Huhwhat then contains an additional 50 coins instead.
Several monsters similar to a Huhwhat also appear in the game, those being a Whuhoh, Pleaseno, and Comeon.
