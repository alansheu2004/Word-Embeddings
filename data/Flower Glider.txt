The Flower Glider is a glider in the Mario Kart series.

The glider first appears in Mario Kart 7 as an unlockable glider. Here, it resembles a Bellis flower. It offers a small acceleration boost, while hindering the weight stat. Like all the other gliders, it allows karts to go airborne for a set period of time.

In Mario Kart 8, the Flower Glider is given a new look, where it now resembles a sunflower. In a Play Nintendo video showcasing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, it is referred to as the "Daisy Glider". In GBA Ribbon Road, a box for a 1/7 Scale Biddybuggy toy vehicle packaged with a Flower Glider can be seen in the background.
In Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, CPU Baby Daisy, Yoshi, and Birdo use this with the Wild Wiggler body.

The Flower Glider returns in Mario Kart Tour, classified as a Super glider. In this version, it keeps its redesign from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Flower Glider provides better chances of getting Bananas from Item Boxes and increases the number of bonus points earned for hitting other drivers with Bananas.
The game introduces a pink variant, simply named the Pink Flower Glider, a blue variant that is referred to as the Blue Flower Glider, and a white variant that resembles its Mario Kart 7 appearance named the Daisy Glider. A similar glider called the Smiley Flower Glider also appears in this game.
