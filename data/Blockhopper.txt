Blockhoppers are enemies in New Super Mario Bros. They each disguise themselves as a ? Block with bricks on top of it, which can be distinguished by the fact that the question mark on it is motionless. They are found only in World 2-5. When approached by the player character, a Blockhopper reveals a black body with blue feet. Blockhoppers hop at every vocal "paah" in the background music, and Blockhoppers move in the direction that the player character if facing if he is standing on a Blockhopper. A Blockhopper's block disguise makes it harmless on contact, though it can still defeat the player character by landing on him. Blockhoppers can be defeated with a thrown Koopa Shell or a Ground Pound or by running into them using the shell dash ability using the Blue Shell. Mini Mario cannot defeat Blockhoppers due to his very small size. If the ? Block on a Blockhopper is ground-pounded, Mario or Luigi receives a coin or an item such as an ordinary ? Block.
Blockhoppers are similar to the Pile Driver Micro-Goombas that disguise themselves as blocks from Super Mario Bros. 3 and the hopping Fake Blocks and segmented Blokkabloks from Super Mario 3D Land.
