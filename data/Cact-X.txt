The Cact-X is a kart in the Mario Kart series. As its name states, the kart body is shaped like a cactus, more specifically a saguaro cactus due to the exhaust pipes being cactus arms. It has a spike at the front similar to the stinger at the front of the Bumble V. The emblem is located on the hood (and on the back of the engine in Mario Kart Tour).

The Cact-X first appears in Mario Kart 7 as an unlockable kart body part. It offers a boost in handling and off-road but has reductions in speed and acceleration. It is one of the only five karts to increase off-road boost, with the other four being the Bolt Buggy, Bumble V, Pipe Frame, and Tiny Tug. It has the same engine sound as the Koopa Clown, which is a V-twin engine. 
CPU Toad has a preference for using this body.

The Cact-X reappears in Mario Kart Tour, where it is classified as a High-End kart. It increases the length of Slipstream boosts and the amount of points earned for performing Slipstreams. It uses the Sponge tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. An icy-blue variant named the Cact-Ice was introduced in the Snow Tour, a red variant named the Cact-R was introduced in the Toad vs. Toadette Tour, and a black variant named the Cact-B was introduced in the 2022 Bowser Tour. All three variants are classified as High-End karts.
The Cact-X was added to the game in the Wild West Tour and has since appeared in the First Pipe and Second Pipe of every tour. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The table below shows the kart's other availabilities by tour.
