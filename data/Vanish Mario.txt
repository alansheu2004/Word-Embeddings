Vanish Mario (alternatively Pixel Mario) is one of Mario's special forms from Super Mario 64. Mario can transform into it by collecting a Vanish Cap, found inside blue Cap Blocks, which are activated by triggering the Cap Switch in the Vanish Cap Under the Moat secret area. As Vanish Mario, he is invisible to enemies (and dithered to the player) and is thus able to pass by them unharmed. In addition, he is able to pass through cages, ice, and certain walls. However, he can still be defeated by drowning, being crushed, or falling from heights.
In Dire, Dire Docks, Vanish Mario can combine his Vanish Cap with the Metal Cap to become Vanish Metal Mario, which protects him from drowning or suffocating, while maintaining the ability to go through certain walls.
In Super Mario 64 DS, the Vanish form, herein referred to as Invisibility Power, is granted exclusively to Luigi; however, the differences in terms of gameplay, aside from Luigi's slightly different handling, are subtle. As the Vanish Cap is absent in the remake, a Power Flower, which is typically found in a red ? Block, is required for the transformation. Additionally, Vanish Mario can walk through ice, whereas Luigi cannot. However, Luigi cannot be seen by some enemies and can pass through walls and cages vertically and horizontally, while Mario can only pass through walls horizontally and can still be seen by some enemies.
