"In the Whirlpool" is a playable song in Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix. It is an arrangement of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 by Sir Edward Elgar.
The song serves as stage 2-3 of regular Story Mode, which is also titled In the Whirlpool. Having obtained the Boogie Booster, Mario or Luigi uses it to pilot the SS Brass through the swirling water. This serves as the background of the song, cutting between shots of the player character steering the ship and dancing inside it, and exterior shots of the ship moving through the water and passing by Cheep Cheeps and Bloopers.
In Mush Mode, this song's only gimmick is Spinies. If stepped on, they explode and drastically decrease the dance meter. Green Spinies move at a regular speed, while red Spinies move significantly faster.
