The Pink Dozer is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2021 Trick Tour and is the signature kart of Builder Toadette and Builder Toad. The kart is a fuchsia-colored variant of the Dozer Dasher, as its name indicates, and has a yellow seat, white hazard stripes, and black accents. Unlike the Dozer Dasher, it uses fuchsia and gold versions of the Monster tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Also unlike the Dozer Dasher, this kart increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the amount of points earned upon performing Jump Boosts.

As of the 2022 Mii Tour, the Pink Dozer is available in all regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. It is currently not a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows the kart's special availability by tour.
