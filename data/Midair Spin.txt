The Midair Spin is a special move that Mario and his allies can perform in all 2D Super Mario games since New Super Mario Bros. Wii (excluding New Super Mario Bros. 2). It consists of a 360Â° spin in the air that delays the character's falling for a split second, allowing them to stay in midair longer. It is possible to perform multiple Midair Spins while in midair. There is a period after a Midair Spin where another Midair Spin cannot be used, but said period ends if the player character lands on the ground.
In Super Mario Run, this move creates blue stars that contribute to starting a Coin Rush. Yoshi, Red Yoshi, Blue Yoshi, Yellow Yoshi, Purple Yoshi, Peach, and Daisy cannot use the Midair Spin in this game, because their action in the air is different. Yoshis use the Flutter Jump, Peach uses the Floaty Jump, and Daisy uses the Double Jump.
