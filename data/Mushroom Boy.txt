The Mushroom Boy is a Mushroom person that lives in Seaside Town during the events of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. He has the same striped mushroom cap design as the natives of Rose Town, implying that he may have originally been from there. The Mushroom Boy's Shop, also known as the Mushroom Shop, is a specialty store. Instead of selling items, weapons, etc., the Mushroom Boy trades special items for rare Mushrooms. These Mushrooms are found randomly among Mushrooms that can be bought or found. Because they all look the same, adventurers have to return any Mushrooms they pick to the Mushroom Boy, who then uses his refined palate to determine whether a Mushroom is rare or not. Rare mushrooms are rewarded with items, while regular Mushrooms are not compensated.
Items that can be gained in exchange for Mushrooms include Rock Candy, Maple Syrup, and Flower Tabs. 
The Mushroom Boy, along with the other residents of Seaside Town, are held hostage by the Smithy Gang during Speardovich's occupation of the city. The residents of the village are eventually saved by Mario and his party.
