The Sistine Chapel ceiling is an item in the SNES and NES versions of Mario is Missing!. It is literally the entire roof of the Sistine Chapel, as painted by Michelangelo Buonarroti. It gets stolen in its entirety by Koopa Troopas when they attack the city of Rome. Luigi then single-handedly takes it from a Koopa Troopa roaming Rome's streets. As he does not recognize it, he then shows it to other people within the city, who describe the ceiling's history and where it belongs. Eventually, Luigi takes it to the Sistine Chapel's information booth and gives it back after proving that the ceiling in his possession is the real deal. It appears in place of Michelangelo's Paintbrush (which is presumably also depicted on the item's NES sprite) from the PC versions. The SNES sprite depicts part of The Creation of Adam, albeit with Adam's genitals censored with a fig leaf.
