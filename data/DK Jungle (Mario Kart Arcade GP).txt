DK Jungle is a track in the game Mario Kart Arcade GP and Mario Kart Arcade GP 2. It is a small oval track, similar to Baby Park from Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. However, thick plants obscure the view and Piranha Plants snap at racers, though the Piranha Plants are aesthetic effects only. On the second straight road of the course, two wooden bridges traverse water, which, if driven on, slows drivers. Multiple Diddy Kongs, along with Animal Friends Rambi, Expresso, and Quawks, make cameos throughout the track.
This track's layout would later be reused in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, stripped of its Donkey Kong theming and altered into Bon Dance Street, which is themed around Don-chan.
