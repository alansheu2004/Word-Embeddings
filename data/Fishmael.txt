Fishmael is seen in Paper Mario fishing by the docks at the port and arguing with a Fuzzipede. Parakarry and Mario can deliver letters between him and his fishing buddies, Goompapa, Muss T., and Koover. He loves to fish and is always seen fishing in the ports of Toad Town. It is completely unknown what creature he is, although the fishing rod sticking out of his head resembles the antenna of a female anglerfish and his face is reminiscent of many cartoon fish. His name comes from Ishmael, the sailor/teacher from the famous 19th century novel Moby-Dick, whose name in turn comes from Ishmael, the son of Hagar and Abraham. His name is also similar to the item "Fishmeal", a brown powder created when fish is processed. His name is revealed from the description of the letter addressed to him, but it is later mentioned again in a dialogue from the Fuzzipede after Chapter 6 is completed. In the Japanese version of the game, he is simply described as つりをしている人 (tsuri o shiteiru hito) in the description of the letter and つり人 (tsuribito) by Fuzzipede, both of which translate to "the fishing person". Goombario's Tattle does not include his name in either version.
