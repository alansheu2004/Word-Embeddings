Jagger is a Terrapin that appears in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. After the Smithy Gang invades Bowser's Keep, Jagger is first seen leading Bowser's troop of Terrapins in Rose Way. However, realizing that he is not strong enough in his present state to fight the forces of Smithy, he flees to Monstro Town, a village of reformed monsters. Once there, Jagger meets the martial arts master Jinx. Jinx, seeing potential in him, allows Jagger to become his student. Jagger trains day and night, hoping to become strong enough to eventually challenge the forces of Smithy and reclaim Bowser's Keep.
If Mario and Bowser visit the dojo in town, Jagger is shocked to see his former king. He apologizes to Bowser for running away and promises to someday join him in reclaiming his keep. Bowser tells Jagger that he is not obligated to do so and that his services are not needed, as Bowser has acquired new "Minions" (namely Mario, Mallow, Geno, and Princess Peach) to vanquish Smithy. Bowser, in fact, encourages Jagger to continue his training and self-realization rather than rejoining the Koopas. As a test, Jagger challenges Mario and his allies to a friendly fight.
Although Jagger has attained a rare level of skill, he ultimately loses and his master, Jinx, reveals himself. If Jinx is defeated three times, Mario is given an honor held only by the highest-ranking fighter, the Jinx Belt, and is told he is the new Sensei. Thus, the dojo becomes "Mario Style Dojo", and Jagger and Jinx study Mario's fighting technique. Jinx proclaims their first training assignment is to jump one thousand times, which Mario does not have a say in. They continue to do this endlessly for the rest of the game.
