The Ventas Bullring (properly Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas) is a bullring in Madrid, Spain.

Alongside the Palacio de las Cortes and the Prado Museum, the Ventas Bullring is one of the landmarks in Madrid in Mario is Missing!, although it is exclusive to the DOS and Deluxe versions. It gets raided by Koopa Troopas who steal a Matador's Cape; this causes the entire arena to shut down. Said cape is later retrieved by Luigi as he explores the city. He then brings it to the Ventas Bullring's information booth, at which point he is required to prove that the article of clothing is genuine (which he does by answering some questions, seen below). After this process, the arena is reopened to the public.

The Ventas Bullring appears as one of the landmarks in the Madrid Drive 2 course in Mario Kart Tour, where it is seen in the background. Madrid Drive also appears in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of the Booster Course Pass DLC, once again featuring the Ventas Bullring.
