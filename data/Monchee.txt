Monchees, generically referred to as monkeys, are monkey characters appearing in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong, as well as Mario vs. Donkey Kong and its remake.

Monchees are allies in the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong. They are first encountered in Stage 4-3 in the Jungle. Monchees have long tails that hang below their platforms that Mario can use like a regular vertical rope to cross gaps. Holding onto a Monchee's tail while gripping a vine or another Monchee will cause it to squeak as it finds itself unable to move. Monchees are also entirely harmless creatures that will pass through Mario if he contacts them from the side.

Monchees are enemies in Mario vs. Donkey Kong. They have a toylike design, resembling cylindrical, almost barrel-like cymbal-banging monkey toys. They were also given a more robotic-looking variation that moves at a faster pace called Robo Kikki. Like before, Mario can grab and hold onto their tails, which usually hang below whatever platform a Monchee is pacing on. If Mario grabs onto a rope and a Monchee at the same time, the Monchee will remain in place until Mario lets go of either the rope or the Monchee. Riding a Monchee's tail can help Mario get across several obstacles such as spikes. However, unlike their previous appearance, directly touching a Monchee from the side will cause Mario to lose a life. If a Monchee is standing on a color-coded platform, Mario can press a switch of a different color to remove the platform.
