Mario's Face is a tech demo made for the Nintendo DS, developed at an unspecified time by Nintendo EAD. It mainly features Mario's face (along with Wario's) being able to be squeezed, stretched and rotated in various ways, similarly to the title screen of Super Mario 64, although the touch screen can also be used. Additionally, the top screen notably uses graphics similar to the Super Mario All-Stars version of Super Mario Bros.
Despite never being released to the public, the tech demo would be reworked into the title screen of Super Mario 64 DS, albeit with many differences to the original product.
