Gettysburg is a city in Pennsylvania, United States of America that held the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War. The battle was won by the Union, though not without major casualties from both parties, and served as a turning point for the Gettysburg Campaign. It also served as the location for Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address in 1863, taking place near the Gettysburg National Cemetery where many soldiers who had died in the war were put to rest. In Mario's Time Machine, Bowser travels back in time to 1862 to steal Abraham Lincoln's signature Stovepipe Hat, and the area becomes filled with Koopa Troopas, Bodyslam Koopas, and Walking Turnips. Mario, after taking back the Stovepipe Hat, travels back in time himself to Gettysburg to return it. He then travels to a gate marked with the words "GETTYSBURG" and leaves the hat in front it, then leaves (with a newspaper article saying that Lincoln refused to sign the Gettysburg Address without his hat, despite that taking place in 1863).
