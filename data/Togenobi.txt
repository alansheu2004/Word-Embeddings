Togenobi are octopus enemies that appear in Wario Land 4. They only appear in the Emerald Passage level Mystic Lake. Togenobi have four rotating arms holding maces that can hurt Wario if he touches them. They seem to be living in a shell, just like a hermit crab. Wario cannot defeat them, so he must dodge them; he can freely swim through the Togenobi's arms, but touching a mace will make him lose health. In Normal mode, only one Togenobi appears, while two are found in the Hard and S-Hard modes. The Togenobi appearing in all modes are found at the end of the level, near the switch and the Keyzer.
