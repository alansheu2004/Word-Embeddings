Squigs are purple, pig-like enemies that are a stronger version of Squiglets. Their first and so far only appearance is in the game Super Paper Mario. They have twice as much HP as Squiglets and unlike their weaker counterparts, Squigs can also spit rocks at Mario and his allies, similar to Octoroks from the Legend of Zelda series. Each rock gives the player 10 points when destroyed. If part of a combo, the next destroyed rock will reward the player the same amount of points earned from the previously destroyed rock plus an additional 10 points that stacks. They appear in Chapter 1, in Chapter 7 alongside Squogs, and also in the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials in rooms 3, 7, and 8.
Their name comes from either "square" or "squiggle", and "pig".
