Webbers are spider enemies in Wario Land 3 and Dr. Mario 64. 

In Wario Land 3, Webbers can shoot electric projectiles from above at Wario that trigger Electric Wario when hit. The electric projectiles do not travel far horizontally, but if Wario is within range, they home on him. Smash-attacking on the ground near one causes it to slide downwards, after which it will slowly crawl back to its original position, where it will not shoot electricity while doing so. They can repeatedly be dropped until they touch the ground. Their backs can be stood on, which allows Wario to reach high places as they climb back up. After a Webber shoots four projectiles, a baby Webber crawls on its back momentarily before it resumes shooting electricity. They appear in both Out of the Woods and The Big Bridge, where there are three of them in each level. The ability to use them as platforms is not required to collect any treasure chests, but is required to collect all the Musical Coins in those levels.

In Dr. Mario 64, Webber has the lowest CPU difficulty, alongside Spearhead. In Story mode, it is the third opponent both Dr. Mario and Wario face in their respective stories. In Dr. Mario's story, both Dr. Mario and Wario continue chasing Mad Scienstein into a dark forest, where Wario is grabbed by the Webber first, and then grabs Dr. Mario in its attempt to eat him as a snack. In Wario's story, Wario catches up with Mad Scienstein but as Mad Scienstein stops, Wario accidentally ran into a spider web only to be confronted by Webber, who remarks on Wario not being tasty. After both Spearhead and Webber are beaten by either Dr. Mario or Wario, both of them report to the hidden figure about the chase occurring between Dr. Mario, Wario, and Mad Scienstein, who is assured that Hammer-Bot can stop them.
