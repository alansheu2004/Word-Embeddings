Egon is a minor character in the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film. He is briefly seen on the television being interviewed early in the movie during Mario and Luigi's introductory scene at their home. He is guest starring on a television show titled Our Miraculous World where the host (played by Robert D. Raiford) is asking him a series of questions regarding his claims of having traveled to another dimension. Luigi takes interest to the broadcast and tells Mario, who humorously disregards it and turns the television off. The Our Miraculous World segment mentions that Egon went through this dimension shift while at the excavation site that is later revealed to be the one Daisy is overseeing. This is foreshadowing to the eventual traveling to the Dinohattan dimension the brothers partake in, though Egon's character is not referenced again.
