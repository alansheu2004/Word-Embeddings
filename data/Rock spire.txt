Rock spires are stalagmites found in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. In Super Mario Galaxy, rock spires appear as objects that can be broken by Mario or Luigi when hit with a spin. They appear in the Ghostly Galaxy, where the player must destroy a glowing stalagmite to summon a Launch Star in order to complete the mission Matter Splatter Mansion. Rounder rock spires (generically referred to as boulders or obelisks) appear in Super Mario Galaxy 2, where they can be destroyed only by Mario or Luigi's Rock form.
Outside Super Mario Galaxy, stalagmites appear in most titles that feature underground areas. However, they typically serve only as decoration and serve no purpose.
