Piranha Pests are Piranha Plants that appear in two games: Yoshi's Story and Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time.

In Yoshi's Story, Piranha Pests each simply resemble the bud of a Piranha Plant with a propeller instead of a stem or stalk. They fly in rectangular patterns very similar to those of Hootie the Blue Fish in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, though they do not follow the edges of walls. They have tongues almost as long as a Yoshi's, but instead of making eggs, they attempt to swallow the Yoshi and shrink it temporarily. When the Yoshi is shrunk, no Yoshi eggs can be used. Piranha Pests can be defeated with a Yoshi egg only when the Yoshi is in normal size. As with their relatives, they are found in Piranha Grove.

In Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Petey Piranha can spit out Piranha Pests (referred to in the Player's Guide as "plant-pendulums"). These plants use their long tongues to swing on a block, trying to slam into Mario or Luigi. If they are hit with a hammer a few times, they will be defeated.

In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Piranha Pests are mentioned briefly by Viridi during Palutena's Guidance dialogue for Piranha Plant.
