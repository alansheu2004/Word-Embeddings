The Hooraw Medals are items found exclusively in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. They are gold-colored icons with Big Massif's icon on them. Mario and Dreamy Luigi are given one Hooraw Medal for each Hooraw they defeat, and once all four are collected, they must be presented to the announcer in order to face Dreamy Big Massif in battle.
