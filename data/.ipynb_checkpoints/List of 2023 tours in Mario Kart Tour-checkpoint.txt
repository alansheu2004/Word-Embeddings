This is a list of tours in Mario Kart Tour that debuted in 2023.
Courses in gray debuted during the respective tour. "N" indicates a normal course, "R" a reversed course, "T" a trick course, and "R/T" a reversed trick course. Course variations in blue were newly added to the game, variations in green were used in previous tours, and variations in red text have not yet made a reappearance since their debut tour. Cup icons with darkened cells indicate newly added cups.
The 2023 Anniversary Tour was the final tour to add new content to the game. All subsequent tours are reruns of previous tours, starting with 2022's Battle Tour.
