"I Love Mario Kart Tour" is a song performed by YouTuber Roi Wassabi for his channel Guava Juice. It and its corresponding music video were licensed by Nintendo and linked from the official American Mario Kart Facebook account to promote Mario Kart Tour. The song offers a rundown of the game's features, such as its modes, drivers, and items.

In the song's music video, Wassabi plays both himself (here referred to with his first name, "Roi") and his aunt, Tita Mary Grace. The aunt challenges Roi to a race in Mario Kart Tour after he declines her request to clean the bathroom. Her terms are as follows: if Roi wins the race, he does not have to do chores for the day, but if he loses, he has to delete his YouTube channel. The song begins before Roi could consent to the challenge. At the end of the song, Tita Mary Grace wins the race and demands Roi to give her the password to his YouTube channel. Despite Roi's desperate pleas, the video abruptly cuts to an error message stating "This Youtube[sic] Channel Has Been DELETED" / "15,000,000+ Subscribers Gone".
During the song itself, the video uses artwork and footage from the game to show what the characters are singing about.

The following is a transcription of the song's lyrics as they are displayed in the music video. Lyrics written in green are performed by Roi, those written in red are performed by Tita Mary Grace, and those in black are performed by both simultaneously.
