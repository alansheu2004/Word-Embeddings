Lulla-Bye is an attack used by enemies in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. As its namesake "lullaby" implies, the enemy emits a melody, usually causing the characters to fall asleep, making the affected character unable to do any action for its duration. It can be cured with any item that can remove Sleep. Its effect is similar to that of Elegy's; the only noticeable difference is that the song that is played is the Super Mario World main theme.
