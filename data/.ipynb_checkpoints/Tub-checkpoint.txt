Tubs, also known as Basins, are items that appear in Mario Kart Arcade GP, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2, and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX. The item is based on the common Japanese slapstick gag of basins falling on people's heads.
When used, they lock-on to an opponent and whack them on the head. Although the Tub is a basic item, it flattens the opponent like a Thwomp, stopping the targeted player and allowing other players to pass by. Tubs can come in singles and in triples, under the name of Triple Tub or Triple Basin, which can be unlocked as a Prize Item.
