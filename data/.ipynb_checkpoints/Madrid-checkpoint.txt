Madrid is the capital city of Spain. It appears as a playable location in Mario is Missing! and Mario Kart Tour.

Alongside Athens, Marrakech, Mexico City, and Paris, Madrid is one of the five cities in the DOS and Deluxe versions of Mario is Missing! that Luigi has to visit before he can fight Roy Koopa. The city has been attacked by a group of Koopa Troopas, resulting in various landmarks losing notable items: Guernica from the Prado Museum, a Matador's Cape from the Ventas Bullring, and the tail from one of the lion statues in front of the Palacio de las Cortes. A bounty is placed on the items' return by Mayor Smallburg, and Luigi sets out to return them. He does just that, fighting off Koopa Troopas and chatting with the locals, and once every item is brought back to its rightful spot, he leaves for Bowser's Castle.

Madrid appears in Mario Kart Tour as the location of a race course called Madrid Drive. The course debuted in the 2023 Summer Tour. Madrid was the fourteenth and final city to be added to the game, as well as the seventh European city to be added to the game, being the third in a row after Athens and Rome. The course features landmarks such as Plaza Mayor, Puerta del Sol (including the Royal Post Office, El Oso y el Madroño, and the Sol Metro station), the Puerta de Alcalá, Gran Vía, Edificio Metrópolis, Edificio Capitol, Edificio Grassy, the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, the Market of San Miguel, Cybele Palace, Plaza de Cibeles, the Fountain of Cybele, the Gate of Europe, Hotel Riu Plaza España, Atocha station, Retiro Park, the Prado Museum, the Calle de Preciados, the Fuente del Ángel Caído, and the Segovia Viaduct.
Madrid Drive returns in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in the sixth and final wave of the Booster Course Pass. In that game, it is the first course of the Spiny Cup.
