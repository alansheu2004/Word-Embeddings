Samantha Kelly (credited as Sam Kelly in many games) is Princess Peach and Toad's current and longest running voice actress, replacing Nicole Mills and Jen Taylor. She has provided their voice work since Mario Strikers Charged and Mario Party 8 respectively (excluding Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Mario Tennis Open (for Princess Peach), and Mario Kart Arcade GP DX). She also voices Toadette, Baby Peach and Pink Gold Peach. Some games use the voice clips of Jen Taylor or Nicole Mills with those of Kelly, such as Mario Tennis Aces and Mario Strikers Charged.
Though she does not voice Peach and Toad in The Super Mario Bros. Movie (who are instead voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy and Keegan-Michael Key respectively), some Toads in the movie utter reused voice clips of Kelly's portrayal of the Toad species.

Samantha Kelly was born in Nairobi, Kenya and has lived in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, and Germany. She has been married to Carlos Roland since August 12, 2005. They have two children. She was previously married to Scott D. Fralick from November 24, 1990 until they divorced on October 11, 2002. Prior to video games, she has done voiceover work for Nordstrom and other commercials. After Jen Taylor left the role of Princess Peach and Nicole Mills filled in as the temporary voice, an agent had Kelly audition for the role and was chosen.
