The Magic Parasol is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2021 Halloween Tour. The glider is an orange and black variant of the Peach Parasol with a purple spiderweb-like design at the top, and black bows with orange polka dots that design-wise resembles Wendy's bow and color-wise resembles Birdo (Black)'s emblem. It is the signature glider of Peach (Halloween). Unlike the Peach Parasol, this glider improves the chances of getting Bananas from Item Boxes and increases the number of bonus points earned for landing hits with Bananas.

The Magic Parasol is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and it is not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's availability by tour.
