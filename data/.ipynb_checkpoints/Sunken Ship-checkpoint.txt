The Sunken Ship is a location that appears in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. According to the notes scattered throughout the ship, it sank when the giant Blooper, King Calamari, attacked it. Before the ship sank completely, the crew managed to seal King Calamari in the treasure cellar. The ship has two portions, an upper one and a lower one, and the treasure cellar is between both.
The upper portion is filled with undead enemies like Dry Bones and Greapers. There are also several rooms containing puzzles and challenges that, when solved, give clues as to what the password needed to open the treasure cellar is. A Shaman merchant can also be found, who can additionally tell the player how close the password was to being correct. King Calamari must be defeated before being able to proceed to the ship's lower portion.
The lower portion is almost completely submerged and filled with territorial sea creatures. This section is ruled by the infamous pirate Jonathan "Johnny" Jones and his crew of Bandana Reds and Bandana Blues.
