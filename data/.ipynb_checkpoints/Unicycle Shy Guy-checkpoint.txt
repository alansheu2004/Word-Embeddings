Unicycle Shy Guys are a variant of Shy Guy that first appear in Paper Mario: Color Splash.

In Paper Mario: Color Splash, one group of green Unicycle Shy Guys is found in the Emerald Circus, riding a single unicycle together. There are eight Unicycle Shy Guys riding the unicycle, and Mario must defeat them by jumping on them one at a time. They attack Mario by riding their unicycle into him. If they are not all defeated in one turn, more Shy Guys will come and replace the defeated ones.

Unicycle Shy Guys later appear in Yoshi's Crafted World. Here, only one Shy Guy rides the unicycle, and they only appear in Hoop-Jump Hop. They have jester-like attire like Juggling Heyho. If Yoshi gets run by a Unicycle Shy Guy, he gets hurt. However, he can defeat them with any attack, and can eat them to make eggs.
