Berlin is the capital city of Germany in Europe. It appears as a location in Mario is Missing! and Mario Kart Tour.

Berlin is exclusive to the PC version of Mario is Missing!. It is part of the third level set (alongside Sydney, Kathmandu, Buenos Aires, and Dublin), all of which Luigi has to visit in order to defeat Wendy O. Koopa. Just like all the other cities in Mario is Missing!, Berlin was invaded by Koopa Troopas. The enemies steal artifacts from various local landmarks: a horseshoe from the statue on top of the Brandenburg Gate, a park bench from Unter den Linden, a brick from the Berlin Wall, and Sophie Charlotte's Crown from Charlottenburg Palace. Luigi is asked to recover all of the artifacts by Mayor Laabs.

Berlin indirectly appears in the NES version of Mario's Time Machine, as Mario travels back to the Berlin Wall's destruction in 1989.

Berlin reappears in Mario Kart Tour, introducing Berlin Byways in the Berlin Tour themed around it, which also includes a new course based on the city. Oddly, its second route, Berlin Byways 2, was introduced first. The course labeled as the first route, Berlin Byways, would not debut until the Metropolitan Tour. The third route, Berlin Byways 3, debuted in the 2022 Anniversary Tour.
Some of the landmarks in Berlin can be seen, including the Berlin Cathedral, Berlin Central Station, Berlin Palace, Berlin Television Tower, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Wall, Bode Museum, Brandenburg Gate, Charlottenburg Palace, East Side Gallery, Gendarmenmarkt, Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, Mercedes-Benz Arena, Molecule Man, Neptune Fountain, New Synagogue, Oberbaum Bridge, Rotes Rathaus, Schiller Monument, Sony Center, Spree River, St. Mary's Church, Tempodrom, and the Tiergarten.
Berlin Byways returns as the first course in the Moon Cup of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe's Booster Course Pass.
