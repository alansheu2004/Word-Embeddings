The Manager is a high-ranking member of the Smithy Gang in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. In battle, the Manager wields a large axe that resembles the Blade. He is also guarded by three Pounders, small hammer-like enemies. Before he was defeated by Mario and his allies, he mentioned the creation of Mack 2 and Yaridovich 2 ("the Claymorton and Speardovich clones" in the remake), presumably referring to the Machine Made variants. The Manager is between ranks of Clerk and the Director.
