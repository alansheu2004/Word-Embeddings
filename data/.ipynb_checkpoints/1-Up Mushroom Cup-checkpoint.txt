The 1-Up Mushroom Cup is the tournament that debuts in Mario Tennis Open. It can be considered the counterpart to the World Open Mushroom Cup. The trophy earned from beating this tournament is similar to the Mushroom Cup trophy, but the Mushroom is a 1-Up Mushroom. Also, the stand is slightly higher and the design is slightly different. The color of the stand for the trophy is silver rather than blue for the Mushroom Cup trophy.
The 1-Up Mushroom Cup is the first cup in the Star Open tournament series. Players can unlock this cup by beating the Champions Cup in the World Open series. By doing this, the character earns a star rank, which grants him or her the ability to participate in the Star Open tournament. The computer player's difficulty is comparable to the earlier cups in the World Open series, but their power is increased significantly because they have a star rank as well.
This cup is played in Peach's Palace, and matches here have one set each for the starting and semifinal rounds, and three sets for the finals.
