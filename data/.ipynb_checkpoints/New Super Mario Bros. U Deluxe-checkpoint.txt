New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe is a side-scrolling 2.5D platform game released on the Nintendo Switch worldwide on January 11, 2019. It is a port of the 2012 Wii U launch title New Super Mario Bros. U, containing both the original base game and its New Super Luigi U DLC. Mario, Luigi, Yellow Toad, Blue Toad (both generically named Toad in this game), and Nabbit (now also playable outside of New Super Luigi U) all return as playable characters, in addition to a new playable character, Toadette, who replaces Blue Toad in cutscenes. She has a unique form known as Peachette, which she obtains using a new power-up called the Super Crown, granting her abilities similar but not identical to those of the Flying Squirrel form.

A browser game was released on the Play Nintendo website in 2019 called New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe Power-Ups Trivia Quiz.

Similarly to the original New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe has received generally positive reviews from critics.

As of June 30, 2024, the game had sold 17.61 million units worldwide.

During the September 2018 Nintendo Direct, Mario was shown being used in Waddlewing Warning! and Larry's Trigger-Happy Castle, two New Super Luigi U levels. However, Mario is not playable in the New Super Luigi U levels in the final game, as is the case in the original New Super Luigi U.
