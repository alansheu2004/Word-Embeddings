Dyllis is a chef in Super Paper Mario. She runs the Hot Fraun, a restaurant located on the first floor of Flopside. She is the Flopside counterpart of Saffron, the Flipside chef. Other than their personalities, Dyllis differs from Saffron because she requires two ingredients to make a dish, as opposed to Saffron who needs one.
The player can come to the restaurant and supply two ingredients to Dyllis, which she combines into one item. Dyllis could be described as paralleling the characteristics of Zess T., a cook from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, for her irritable and gruff personality, demanding ingredients and calling the player names like "bratwurst" and "schnitzel." The Mistake is the only dish that can be made by both Dyllis and Saffron.
Dyllis's name is derived from "dill", a herb whose leaves and seeds are used as a spice in cooking. It also references the phrase "dill pickle", since her attitude is sour.
