Battle Stadium is a battle course in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, appearing as one of the new courses added to the game. Battle Stadium bears a resemblance to Mario Kart Stadium, using some of the assets from the track - it also repurposes elements of Excitebike Arena and DS Wario Stadium with alterations. It is in a similar shape to an "8"  signifying the game's title with ramps in several areas along with an anti-gravity ring around the middle. The course is fairly simplistic in design. Underneath the Battle Stadium appears to be a small town with several other vehicles driving along the roads and the local multiplayer menu background. At one end of the stage, there is a statue of Mario on a Standard ATV, while on the other side there is a statue of Bowser on a Badwagon. This possibly signifies the rivalry between the two characters.
