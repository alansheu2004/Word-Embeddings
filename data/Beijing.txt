Beijing (Chinese: 北京; Pinyin: Běijīng; Wade–Giles: Pei-ching; Jyutping: bak1 ging1; Yale Cantonese: Bākgīng) is the capital city of China. It appears in the PC, SNES, and NES versions of Mario is Missing!, but its place in the game varies. In the PC and SNES versions, it's part of the first level set; in the NES version, it is instead part of the final pair of levels alongside Nairobi. During the events of the game, Luigi's task (given to him by Mayor McChan in the PC versions) is to return artifacts from famous landmarks in Beijing: the Hall of Good Harvest from the Temple of Heaven, a stone from the Great Wall of China, the Gate of Heavenly Peace from the Forbidden City, and (exclusively in the DOS and Deluxe versions) the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tian An Men Square. When walking around the city, Luigi also walks across Beijing's Main Street, Chang An Avenue, as confirmed by the city's police officer.
In Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, Beijing is the official site of the titular Olympic Games.
