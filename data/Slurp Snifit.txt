Slurp Snifits are a variant of Snifits that appear in Paper Mario: Color Splash. They carry straws in the nozzle of their masks, which can steal the colors of other things. Unlike regular Snifits, the pink and green variants do not appear, while there are blue, red and yellow ones that correspond to the primary colors of paint Mario can possess. When they attack in a battle, they drain one of Mario's three color bars according to their color, so he cannot paint cards of that color until he recovers his paint. This effect is more drastic than that of a Slurp Guy.
