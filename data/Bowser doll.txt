The Bowser doll is a toy in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. The Bowser doll is owned by Gaz, the son of the Rose Town innkeeper. Gaz likes to recreate Mario's various adventures using his Mario doll, Peach doll, and Bowser doll. When Mario arrives in Rose Town, he decides to join Gaz in playing with the dolls. Gaz decides that he will be "Mario" and that the real Mario will use the Bowser doll. During a pretend battle of the dolls, "Mario" loses to "Bowser," thus the Bowser doll must fight Gaz's favorite doll, Geno. However, the battle ends prematurely as Geno's Shooting Star Shot accidentally hits Mario, not the Bowser doll.
