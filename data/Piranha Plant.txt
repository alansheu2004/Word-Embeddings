Piranha Plants (also known as Piranha Flowers and Piranhas and misspelled as pirana plants in early manuals and Pirahna Flower) are enemies introduced in Super Mario Bros. They are large, carnivorous plants based on Venus flytraps. The head of a Piranha Plant is most commonly either red or green with multiple other colors. Piranha Plants originally appeared only in pipes, emerging from them with a biting animation, but have also been encountered outside of them since. Piranha Plants can talk in some appearances. Certain Piranha Plants have animal-like bodies, most noticeably their leader Petey Piranha, making them capable of walking.

Piranha Plants appear in Super Mario Bros. They are first encountered in World 1-2. Piranha were supposed to appear in every vertical pipe beyond the first level, but a glitch prevents them from appearing in every one, like in World 8-4, where the water tiles overlap the Piranha Plant in the original version only; if the Piranha Plant had been visible, the underwater palette would have rendered it gray. Piranha Plants do not emerge from pipes if the player character stands either adjacent to or on top of them, not unlike Turtle Cannons. Piranha Plants can be defeated only from either a fireball or the effects of a Starman. Piranha Plants do not flip upside-down when defeated, unlike other enemies except Buzzy Beetles. Piranha Plants emerge from pipes in Warp Zones but vanish the instant that "WELCOME TO WARP ZONE!" appears onscreen. Piranha Plants emerge from the last pipe at the end of every level taking place mostly underground or underwater.

Piranha Plants return in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. The normal type is encountered in the first three worlds, but levels from World 4-1 onward replace them with the red type. The red variation is faster and still emerges from its pipe if the player character stands by it, but not if they are on top. There are Piranha Plants that emerge from upside-down pipes, and they are first encountered in World 5-1. There are Piranha Plants encountered underwater in World 9-1 and World 9-2. Piranha Plants in All Night Nippon: Super Mario Bros. were cosmetically altered to become Pakkun OkapÄ«.

Piranha Plants appear in Super Mario Bros. 3. They return in red and green varieties, but the only difference is that red Piranha Plants have an additional layer of leaves. Piranha Plants behave similarly as before, though Koopa shells, hammers, and the tail of Raccoon Mario or Tanooki Mario are additional ways to defeat them. A few variants make their first appearance, including Venus Fire Traps, Piranhacus Giganticus, Ptooies, Walking Piranhas, and Munchers. The Piranha Plants that move in and out of upside-down pipes are named Hanging Piranha Plant. Some red Piranha Plants emerge from horizontal pipes but have only one set of leaves. The king of Pipe Land is transformed into a Piranha Plant in the Family Computer and Nintendo Entertainment System version only. An upside-down variant of the Piranha Plant with a red head and one layer of green leaves appears in the World-e levels Piped Full of Plants and Treacherous Halls in Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3.

Pakkun Flowers, or Pakkun, return in Super Mario Land. Upside Down (Headstand) Pakkun, also named Reverse Pakkun or Upside-down Piranha Plant, which gives 400 points when defeated. The digital manual of the Virtual Console port rectifies their name to Piranha Plants.

Piranha Plants return in Super Mario World. From this game forward, red has become the standard color of all Piranha Plants, and the green ones appear only at the end of a growing beanstalk. Besides Munchers returning, another variant was added, Jumping Piranha Plant, which are significantly more common. The regular Piranha Plant, also known as Piranha in a Pipe, appears only in Vanilla Dome 3, where all eight emerge from upside-down pipes. Unlike before, Piranha Plants retreat into their pipe whenever the player character is nearby. Piranha Plants are defeated from either a fireball, a shell, being hit by a cape, or being eaten by Yoshi.

An upward-facing Piranha Plant was scrapped during development. The graphics of the right-side-up stem were overwritten by an upside-down red Cheep Cheep.

Piranha Plants return in Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins. They are no different from before. Besides the returning Venus Fire Traps, the game adds Piranha Plant statues, which sometimes attack by shooting balls of fire.

Piranha Plants are enemies in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS. They are depicted with green lips in the original version, later changed to white in remakes. Piranha Plants appear only in Whomp's Fortress, as well as in Goomboss Battle and Sunshine Isles in the remake. Three Piranha Plants are included in an additional area of Whomp's Fortress in the remake, but they are different in that they emerge from the grass when approached. Piranha Plants have a sleepy nature, which is why they are always found asleep, but a lullaby plays during this. When a Piranha Plant is either touched or approached quickly by the player character, it wakes up and starts to bite in the direction of the player character, though they stay asleep if approached quickly. Piranha Plants take away three health points if they bite the player character, or four if he is without his cap (excluding Yoshi in the remake). Besides Piranha Plants, there are Venus Fire Traps, including small and large versions encountered mainly in Tiny-Huge Island. Piranha Plants can be defeated mainly from being punched or ground-pounded while asleep, or from one of Yoshi's Eggs in the remake. A defeated Piranha Plant shrinks as pink bubbles fly out from its body, and releases a Blue Coin as a spoil.

Piranha Plants, also called Pakkun Flowers, appear in Super Mario Sunshine. They are depicted after their appearance from Super Mario 64, since their lips are green, but they lack teeth. Piranha Plants are encountered only in Bianco Hills. They pop out of the ground and spit black, white-spotted projectiles to attack Mario. A Piranha Plant is defeated if enough water from FLUDD is sprayed into its body until it blows up. Various Piranha Plant members make their debut, including the recurring mini-boss Proto Piranha, the boss and future recurring character Petey Piranha, and enemies named Piranhabons.

Piranha Plants appear in New Super Mario Bros. They retain their attack pattern introduced in Super Mario Bros., but with an added chomping sound effect. Some Piranha Plants appear in the ground, as well as on conveyor belts, which move them around. Two Piranha Plant varieties return, including Venus Fire Traps and Super Piranha Plants.

Piranha Plants return in Super Mario Galaxy. They attack by trying to bite the player character. A Piranha Plant is defeated from either a stomp, a spin, or being touched by Rainbow Mario. It is stunned temporarily if hit by a Star Bit. Defeating some Piranha Plants is required so that a Sproutle Vine can grow in their place. The game adds Spiny Piranha Plants, a large, purple variant that slams its head to attack, and the boss Dino Piranha, as well as a black-colored variant of it. 

Piranha Plants return in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. They no longer have a chomping sound effect, unlike New Super Mario Bros. Piranha Plants are defeated from an Ice Ball, though Piranha Plants encased in ice cannot be picked up. Piranha Plants cannot hurt a Yoshi if jumped on. Besides the returning Venus Fire Traps, Super Piranha Plants, Munchers, and Big Fire Piranhas, the game gives Piranha Plants another two variants, Stalking Piranha Plants and River Piranha Plants.

Piranha Plants return in Super Mario 3D World and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. They are functionally similar to their behavior introduced in Super Mario Galaxy. Besides the returning Mega Piranha Plants, the game introduces Potted Piranha Plants, which can be carried around to eat enemies; Piranha Creeper, which have a long spiky stem; and cat variations in Bowser's Fury only.

Piranha Plants are course elements in Super Mario Maker, its port, and Super Mario Maker 2. Piranha Plants are in every style except Super Mario World, which has Jumping Piranha Plants instead. Several Piranha Plant variations return, including Big Piranha Plants, Fire Piranha Plants, Jumping Piranha Plants, Big Venus Fire Traps, Munchers, as well as Piranha Creepers in Super Mario Maker 2 only. Piranha Plants can be placed on the ground and do not move around. Super Mario Maker 2 adds the ability to place Piranha Plants upside-down on ceilings, and in the game's added Super Mario 3D World style, Piranha Plants attack by lunging and can be defeated from a stomp, unlike in the other game styles. Super Mario Maker 2 also includes Piranha Plants in a Ninji Speedruns course called Yoshi's Piranha Plant Picnic, where the goal is for Yoshi to swallow twenty-five.

Piranha Plants are enemies in Super Mario Run. They emerge from pipes, retaining their usual biting attack, but not if the player character is standing nearby.

Piranha Plants are a species in Super Mario Odyssey. They are used as flowers in Bowser and Princess Peach's marriage, as well as decorations on Bowser's ship in the opening scene.

After hearing Toad's yells for help, Mario rushes into the patch to rescue him, and tries to fight off a particularly large Piranha Plant by throwing a rock, which the plant bats aside with a stick, giving its brethren the idea of grabbing some clubs to use as weapons as well. Depending on how the accompanying puzzle is solved, the plants either fight each other after Mario tricks one into bludgeoning another, or they succeed in knocking Mario out with a blow to the head.
A patch of Piranha Plants appear near the Mushroom Palace in Leaping Lizards, with Morton, Luigi and Toad navigate through them on the way to Water Land. Some Piranha Plants in Koopa Capers are spotted by Luigi amongst several monsters in Wendy O. Koopa's secret camp in the Magma Pits.

In its trailer, Piranha Plant is seen being approached by Mario before knocking him back and repeatedly biting at him before the tagline is displayed: "Piranha Plant Pipes Up!" ("Piranha Plant Joins the Battle!" in the British English version). Piranha Plant is unlockable in Adventure Mode: World of Light after freeing ten fighters, which occurs automatically if the criteria is fulfilled prior to downloading Piranha Plant. Piranha Plant's basic moves include bites, headbutts, leaf swipes, and pot strikes. Piranha Plant's up special move is Ptooie, which involves shooting spiked balls similarly to the species; its side special move is Poison Breath, which involves spewing a damaging cloud of poison, similarly to Putrid Piranhas; its up special move is Piranhacopter, in which Piranha Plant flies like a Jumping Piranha Plant; its down special move is Long-Stem Strike; and its Final Smash is Petey Piranha, which involves summoning the character to trap opponents in cages, breathe fire on them, and slam the cages onto the ground.

Its back aerial is Fire Breath, in which Piranha Plant spits an explosive fireball in the manner of a Fire Piranha Plant. Its forward tilt is Push and Pull and its down aerial is Flowerpot Meteor. Piranha Plant is one of the heavier fighters, and its mobility is also below-average in many areas, apart from its dashing speed. Piranha Plant was originally intended to have three jumps, but the third jump was removed prior to the fighter's release. Piranha Plant smiles or scowls for certain actions, making it more expressive than in other appearances. Its victory theme is identical to Bowser's and Bowser Jr.'s. One of Piranha Plant's victory poses shows it biting Mario, stopping him from jumping over Piranha Plant, and then smiling after launching him away. The Palutena's Guidance conversation on Piranha Plant reveals Viridi as being very knowledgeable on the species, having written a thesis on it and naming its many variants, irritating Pit and Palutena in the process.

Capsules will only be targeted if other objects are not available.
