Tuskegee is a city in Alabama in the United States of America, notably home to the Tuskegee University (formerly the "Tuskegee Institute"). Under Booker T. Washington, the institute became a successful historically black college, offering a higher education for black individuals. George Washington Carver later became a professor of agriculture there, and conducted many of his experiments relating to farming and peanuts there. In 1915, as Carver is about to start up a machine that presses peanuts into peanut oil, Bowser travels back in time to Tuskegee and steals the machine's Crank Handle, preventing it from working properly (according to Mario's Time Machine). Mario laters travels back in time to Tuskegee himself to return the Crank Handle. As he does not know who the Crank Handle belongs to, he shows it to various people around Tuskegee, including Booker T. Washington, Henry Ford, and one of Carver's students, before concluding that it must belong to Carver. Mario promptly visits Carver in his lab, returns the Crank Handle to him, and leaves Tuskegee as he travels to the present.
