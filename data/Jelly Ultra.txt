A Jelly Ultra is the most valuable type of Mushroom in Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. The only possible way to obtain one is to combine a Jammin' Jelly with an Ultra Mushroom with Zess T.'s or Tayce T.'s cooking ability.

In Paper Mario, a Jelly Ultra is cooked by Tayce T. after combining an Ultra Shroom and Jammin' Jelly. If the player has already used all of the Ultra Shrooms and Jammin' Jellies that are hidden in the game, the only other method to obtain the required ingredients would be from Li'l Oinks at their farm in Toad Town. If the player is equipped with a Refund badge, using a Jelly Ultra in battle gives 113 coins. Selling a Jelly Ultra at the Boo's Shop offers 200 coins, and for all other shops in the game, 150 coins.

In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and its Switch remake, a Jelly Ultra is cooked by Zess T. with the same ingredients. If the player had already used all of the ingredients hidden in the game, the only other way to find these ingredients is buying them at the Deepdown Depot for 200 coins apiece. They can also be purchased by traveling merchant Charlieton for 120 coins, but only once per save file. Selling a Jelly Ultra at the Twilight Shop offers 200 coins, and for all other shops in the game, 150 coins.
