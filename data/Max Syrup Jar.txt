Max Syrup Jars, originally known as Max Syrups, are restorative consumables that appear throughout the Mario & Luigi series. When used, they restore a certain amount of Bros. Points (dependent on the game that they appear in) to their consumer. They are usable both during and outside of a fight.

In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, Max Syrups recover all Bros. Points completely when used. They are sold at Castle Town Item Shop after collecting the Beanstar's four pieces for 150 coins (280 coins in the Japanese version of Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga). A couple of bosses, Lemmy and Roy, both have a 100% chance of dropping a Max Syrup when fought.

In Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, Max Syrup Jars restore 40 Special Points (equivalent to Superstar Saga's Bros Points) when one is used. A few enemies have a chance to drop one after a battle: Beta Kretin and Bowser Memory L have a 100% chance and Air Cheeps have a 30% chance.
In Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey, Max Syrup Jars recover all Bros. Points instead of 40; Bowser's equivalent in the remake is the Miracle Cheese.

In Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, Max Syrup Jars return to their function Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, now recovering 80 Bros. points when consumed. They can be bought from item shops after their inventory is updated for the third time for 540 coins. Lakitus R have a 4% chance of dropping a Max Syrup Jar after a battle.

Max Syrup Jars return in Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam. It retains its appearance from Mario & Luigi: Dream Team.
