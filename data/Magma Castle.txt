The Magma Castle is the front-right fort on Bowser's Castle in Yoshi's Story, and is the final level of the game. Lava here is transported through Bowser's Castle, causing falls and geysers. Enemies encountered include Spikes, Spark Spooks, Puffers, Burner Heih≈ç, and Attacky Sacks. A red dragon and two slugs are also found in the tower. The hidden Heart Coin letter for this stage is R.

The level starts near a dragon, which must be ridden in order to collect some fruits and advance to the next area. Here, lava comes out of pipes, and a Yoshi must traverse some moving platforms while avoiding the lava in order to get to an area with more lava and narrow corridors. After the Yoshi collects 30 fruits, the battle against Baby Bowser starts.
Much like with the Baby Bowser battles at Mecha Castle, Lift Castle, and Ghost Castle, the Yoshi has to knock Baby Bowser off of his pet ghosts three times with either Bob-bombs, egg fireworks, or by dropping spikes on him. However, the Magma Castle variation of the battle is the most difficult of the four, as there are a greater number of Ghosts, and Baby Bowser will always spit a fireball after jumping onto a new Ghost. The Super Happy Tree also offers fewer fruits for the Yoshi to consume.
The second half of the battle remains unchanged, where the Yoshi simply has to combat Baby Bowser with Bob-bombs or egg fireworks, while dodging his fireballs and ground pound attacks. Three additional hits will defeat Baby Bowser, clearing the overall level as a whole.

The Yoshis found the castle and figured the Super Happy Tree was there. Instead, they found hot lava and a hot-tempered Baby Bowser! But happiness wins in the end, and the Yoshis paddled Baby Bowser.
