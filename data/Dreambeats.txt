The Dreambeats are a special type of music that appears in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. They cause those who hear it to fall asleep. Their name is a pun on "drumbeats." Prince Dreambert recognizes the sound, suggesting they are an ancient creation. Beings like Starlow and Pi'illos are immune. No "normal creatures" are able to resist, according to Dreambert. However, the Dreambeats cannot affect people in the Dream World. Bowser and Antasma use the Dreambeats in order to gather energy for the Dream Stone.
When Mario and Luigi reach the summit of Mount Pajamaja, they see Antasma, Bowser, Kamek, Private Goomp, Corporal Paraplonk, and Sergeant Guy with four large speakers. Private Goomp then turns on the speakers and the Dreambeats start playing, making all who hear it fall asleep. Of the group at the mountain's summit, Prince Dreambert, Starlow, and Antasma are unaffected. Bowser covers his ears to protect himself, and the Mario Bros. nearly fall asleep. Luigi appears to be more affected than Mario, only being able to sleepwalk and stumble around.
The Dreambeats spread all across the island, even affecting people inside buildings like Pi'illo Castle. Among the characters specifically seen affected are Broque Monsieur and Brickle. 
The Bros. try to escape, but Luigi falls asleep while Mario fights the drowsiness. Prince Dreambert suggests going to the Dream World to escape the music until it is over. Mario does so by diving through the Dream Portal of Luigi at a Dreampoint on the mountain's summit. He lands in Dreamy Mount Pajamaja, but the Dreambeats cause Luigi to fall into such a deep sleep that the Dream Portal closes while Mario is still in the Dream World. By the time the Bros. reopen the portal, the Dreambeats have stopped and the Mario Bros. continue on their journey.
