The Super Boots are the first upgrade to the Boots. They are found in Boo's Mansion in Paper Mario and inside The Great Tree in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. They increase the power of Mario's Jump attack and allow him to do the trademark Spin Jump. Outside of battle, they allow Mario to break boxes and wooden trap doors and use a more powerful First Strike. Once Mario finds the Ultra Boots, he loses the Super Boots.
In Paper Mario, the Super Boots add to Mario's attack power and allow him to perform Spin Jumps. Once the Ultra Boots are found in Toad Town Tunnels, Mario will lose these boots and the Spin Jump will be upgraded to Tornado Jump.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Mario is granted an extra attack named Spin Jump, which does more damage than a regular jump. In Paper Mario, the boots are bright green with yellow soles, while in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, they are blue with orange soles. Once Mario finds the Ultra Boots at Riverside Station, despite losing this pair, he will still retain his Spin Jump attack while being granted the new Spring Jump attack.
