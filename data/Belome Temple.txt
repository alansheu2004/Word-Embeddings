Belome Temple is a location in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its Nintendo Switch remake. It is a sub-area of Land's End that honors the monster Belome, and has been buried in the vast caverns underneath the desert of Land's End due to the shifting sands over many ages, making it hard to find. Shamans inhabit the temple and will offer their services to anyone who has entered it for a price. One of them offers Mario a shortcut back to the desert for 100 coins, while another one requires 50 coins to let him get his fortune told by hitting the tongues of the three Belome statue-heads from below in a certain order. The fortune and prize the player gets is determined by the order in which the heads were hit.

Further in the temple, there is an additional fortune room with one Belome statue-head, a Shaman, and a tile elevator that appears to be enchanted to move down after receiving a random free fortune that resets when entering the room. Dependent on the fortune, the tile's bottom exit will either bring Mario to the treasure room or the path to the pipe at the end of the temple, which is the only entrance to Monstro Town. If the fortune reads "Sorry, I'm not accepting visitors past my bedtime.", the player will be sent to the treasure room blocked by Belome's sleeping form, which is that of a golden statue; he will vanish if the player gives him the Temple Key. If it reads "Mmm, I'm so hungry! Wish I had something to eat!", the player will be taken to the path to the pipe; the awakened Belome will be encountered and refought when passing through here the first time. Lastly, the mysterious "Gassox" also wanders around the temple.
