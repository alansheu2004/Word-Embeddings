K-9s (known by their full name Blueish-Tinged Gray K-9s on the Monster List in the Nintendo Switch remake) are basic enemies that are found in Bandit's Way in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. The enemy's name is a pun on the word "canine", and is also the nickname of police dogs and the police dog unit. A stronger variant called Chow is found in Land's End.
In the overworld, K-9s tend to walk slowly, either in random paths or slowly following Mario and his party. In the second area of Bandit's Way, two K-9s wander the grounds underneath the flying tile path. If Mario and his party defeat one, another one replaces it. A K-9 in the third area guards a treasure box, while four K-9s in the fourth area of the level chase Mario. As the K-9s of the second area, another K-9 respawns.
Mario can acquire an invincibility star in the fourth area, which causes all the K-9s to move faster, including the pursuing ones.
K-9s fight in groups of two or three and are often fought alongside Spikeys or Frogogs. In battle, they attacks by biting, and have a couple of special attacks. They can use the Howl attack to inflict the Fear status condition, or the Fangs attack that deals 50% more damage than usual.
In the remake's Monster List entry, it states that the species is officially named "Blueish-Tinged Gray K-9", though its name is simply displayed as "K-9" in battle. This is also referenced in the Monster List entry for Chow.
An unused enemy, Juju, mentions K-9 in its thought.
