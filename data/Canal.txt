A canal is an artificial waterway created to be traversed by water vehicles. The canals of Amsterdam make two appearances in the Super Mario franchise.

A Canal first appears in the PC versions of Mario is Missing!. A Koopa Troopa steals the steering wheel of a boat from the canal, which forces the canal to close. Before he leaves Amsterdam, Luigi must recover the steering wheel.
To prove the wheel's authenticity, Luigi must answer the following questions:

Much later, Amsterdam and its canals would reappear in the Mario Kart series in the course Amsterdam Drift, first appearing in Mario Kart Tour. In the course's second and third routes, racers drive underwater in the canals. Amsterdam Drift 2 in particular allows racers to use vertical air currents from vents in the waterway to jump out of the canal and land on boats on its surface.
Amsterdam Drift also appears in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as part of its Booster Course Pass. In this game's version of Amsterdam Drift, which shifts its route every lap, the canals are only driven in on the second lap.
