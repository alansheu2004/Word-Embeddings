Yoshi Cookies are the favorite snack of the Yoshis. They are featured as a special item in various games of the Super Mario franchise and also come in a variety of shapes, including flowers, hearts, squares, circles, and even Yoshi's face. Some cookies are chocolate, vanilla, or sugar cookies with icing or jam in their centers, while others carry a checkerboard design.

In their debut title Yoshi's Cookie, a puzzle game, Yoshi Cookies enter from either the top or the side of the screen as Mario, dressed as a baker, pulls a lever. The plot of the game, in a fashion similar to Tetris or Dr. Mario, is to clear them out as Mario continues to fill the screen with more cookies. This is done by pressing the A Button and shifting an entire row of cookies. Once a row is, either horizontally or vertically, filled with the same kind of cookie, it is cleared from the screen. The Yoshi-shaped cookie acted like any kind of cookie.

In Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, Mario and Yoshi are required to bring Yoshi Cookies to Boshi in exchange for a race. Yoshi Cookies can also be used in battle to summon Yoshi, where he will attempt to eat an enemy. If successful, the enemy is transformed into an item, with the item obtained being determined by the type of enemy. If unsuccessful, Yoshi gives the player a Yoshi Candy or a Yoshi-Ade. Bosses and some enemies cannot be eaten. 
A red Yoshi near the GOAL letters can store Cookies for Mario, up to a limit of 200. If the number of cookies goes over the 200 maximum, the Yoshi will eat the rest.

The following is a list of items and the enemies from which they are transformed in both versions of the game.

Luigi takes four Yoshi Cookies that Kamek dropped and gives one to Baby Luigi immediately. Later, he gives two cookies to Baby Mario and Baby Luigi to calm them down after entering Yoob's Belly.
