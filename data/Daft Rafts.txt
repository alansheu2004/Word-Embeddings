Daft Rafts is a 4-Player minigame in Mario Party 6.

The players are standing on a bridge as the river flows beneath them, with the platforms on it. The bridge then collapses, and the players fall onto the beginning platform.

The object of the minigame is to jump onto the many different rafts to avoid falling. If a player falls in the water or over the waterfall or touches an enemy, they are eliminated. Players who can make it to the last raft, being pulled by a Koopa Troopa in an aquatic vehicle, are declared winners. The last raft appears early if only one player remains. If all the players get eliminated, the minigame ends in a tie.
The only change between day and night is the enemies that appear on the rafts. During the day, Spinies are the obstacles, and at night, Podoboos are.

The final platform comes to a stop at the top of the waterfall, with winning players' animations playing as the Koopa drives away.
