Dyode, also known as the Groovemaster or Groovemaster Dyode by Emmit, is a red adult-like Concordian from Mario & Luigi: Brothership who wears headphones, sunglasses and a disco-themed outfit, along with a speaker on his forehead. His name is a corruption of "diode". He is first seen on Twistee Island moping on the floor over the absence of hair wax he claims to need to "get funky" which prompts a crowd to lose attention. Fortunately, deep in the woods section of Twistee Island, Mario and Luigi can search for a merchant named Spiralia who can furnish them with an item called MaxGlam Wax required to get Dyode out of his blue funk, should her sidequest be completed. After handing it over to Emmit, a cutscene begins to play depicting Dyode dancing impressively in a disco party setting, much to the amusement of Emmit and the crowd. Mario and Luigi can also play a minigame where they can vibe with him by pressing the , ,  or  buttons in a rhythmic manner.
