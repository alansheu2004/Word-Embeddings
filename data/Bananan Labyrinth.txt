The Bananan Labyrinth is the first race track in the Donkey Kong Cup in Mario Kart Arcade GP DX, released alongside DK Jungle in an update on December 18, 2018, in Japan. Its name is similar to Bananan Ruins from Mario Kart Arcade GP and Mario Kart Arcade GP 2. This track is two laps long.

The track starts on a flat stretch of ground that leads to several bumps and a row of Item Boxes, which lead to three turns, the second one containing several Mario Coins. After these turns there is a flat bridge with two sets of three Mario Coins on the right. There is a right turn which leads to a Glide Ramp which leads to a flat pathway leading to a temple. There is several Item Boxes in a row in front of the temple. Inside the temple is several Mario Coins that lead to a left turn that leads to door that opens, leading to a flat path with four Mario Coins in two rows of two. There is several Item Boxes after the pathway and a right turn leading to a flat path with another left turn that leads to a mine area with several Mole Miners that can be seen in mine carts above the drivable path. In the mine area there is a right turn and several Item Boxes, a left turn on a Conveyor Belt and two right turns that leads to a beanstalk area. The beanstalk area contains a flat pathway that leads to a right turn with several Item Boxes, two sets of three Mario Coins, a left turn and a right turn, and three Mario Coins that lead back to the finish line.
