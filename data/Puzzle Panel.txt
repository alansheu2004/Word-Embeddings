Puzzle Panel is one of Yoshi's minigames in Super Mario 64 DS and a Puzzle minigame in New Super Mario Bros. It is based on the game Lights Out.
The minigame's music is the same theme used in Mix-a-Mug in Super Mario 64 DS, whereas the music used in New Super Mario Bros. is the theme from Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land instead.
A harder version of the minigame called Puzzle Panic also appears in Super Mario 64 DS as one of Yoshi's minigames.

The player must match the Touch Screen picture with the top screen picture. Both pictures are made of a grid of panels with Mushrooms on the front and Cape Feathers on the back. Touching a panel with the stylus causes it to flip over, along with the surrounding panels. If the panels are flipped correctly, the two Yoshi statues on the left and right blast off, and the player advances to the next level. Later levels take two or three flips, or "turns," to complete. On each level, the player has three chances. The highest score the player can obtain by clearing the levels is 9,999; the minigame continues after that, but the score counter and level number do not increase. If the player fails to match the two pictures correctly three times, the minigame ends.
In multiplayer, this minigame is timed for 60 seconds. If the panels are flipped incorrectly, one point is lost (it is possible to score below zero) and the two Yoshi statues react in alarm; if the panels are correctly flipped, the player earns one point and moves to the next level. When the timer reaches zero, the player with the most points wins.
