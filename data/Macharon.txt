The Macharon is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the 2019 Paris Tour, it is the signature kart of Peach (Vacation) and Shy Guy (Pastry Chef). The kart's name is derived from the Mach number and "macaron", a type of dessert which also serves as a basis for the design of both the kart itself and its tires. Whipped cream serves as the fenders while the exhaust pipes are light-brown wafers with brown swirls. The emblem is located on the front and rear of the kart. The Macharon increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the number of points earned for performing Jump Boosts.
A brown variant known as the Choco Macharon, which is also classified as a High-End kart, appears in the game beginning with the Cooking Tour.

Starting with the Rosalina Tour, the Macharon is availaible in all regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. Starting with the Battle Tour, it is also available in the Daily Selects lineup. The table below shows this kart's special availabilities by tour.
