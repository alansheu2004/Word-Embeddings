Vizorman is an item that can be purchased from the Item Shop in Wario Land 4. The Vizorman is one of the eight items that can be purchased from the shop owner to assist Wario in defeating a boss by dealing damage at battle's beginning. It resembles a person dressed in a costume with a cape, a vizor, and colorful shoes. It is priced at four medals in Normal difficulty, six medals in Hard difficulty, and eight in S-Hard difficulty. It is one of the weaker items in the game. When purchased, the shop owner will drag the seemingly-inanimate Vizorman to the boss room, with Wario close behind. She will then start charging a laser, which shoots from the Vizor of Vizorman and hits the boss's weak spot, dealing a small amount of damage. When the damage is dealt, the shop owner will leave the room, and Wario will be left to fight a slightly weaker boss.
