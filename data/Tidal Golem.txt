Tidal Golems are water Rabbid/Golems that appear in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, specifically in the The Last Spark Hunter DLC. They are one of three Golem variants that first appear in the The March of the Golems battle in the Melodic Gardens. They bear a slight resemblance to the Icicle Golem from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle, although they are smaller and are actual Rabbids, not entirely composed of rocks. Tidal Golems have rocks with water flowing between them on their backs and shoulders.
In battle, Tidal Golems emit a close range shockwave around them, dealing damage to all heroes in range and inflicting them with the Splash Super Effect. When defeated, they turn into an egg-like state, and must be Dashed or Stomped to properly be dispatched of, otherwise they will revive with full HP on the next turn. The hero that destroys them in their egg state will receive the Splash Super Effect to their weapon for that turn. Tidal Golems are weak to Shock and resist Splash.

GOLEM SHELL
When a Golem reaches 0 HP, it will revert to an embryonic state that is invincible to all but dashing or stomping. It will spawn back as a Golem if not destroyed during this state.

One of three Golem mutations found on the Melodic Gardens, they were rejected by their creator, Cursa, who found them lacking. They have since been repurposed, with their DNA altered by person or persons unknown. This subspecies unleashes a seismic Splash attack affecting all those around it. When defeated, it enters a chrysalis-like state. If not dashed, it is reborn. It is weak versus Shock-based attacks.
