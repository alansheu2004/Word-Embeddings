The Prop Kart is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour, which debuted in the Sky Tour. It is the signature kart of Mario (Aviator). The kart resembles a red biplane with a red seat and a yellow and black propeller that turns while driving. Its overall design is inspired by German ace-of-aces combat pilot Manfred von Richthofen, better known as "The Red Baron" who flew red colored biplanes in World War I. The emblem is located on the wings, which are similar in design to those of the Sky-High Flyer. The Prop Kart uses the Pipe Frame's tires and increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the points earned for performing a Jump Boost.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Prop Kart is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup.
