Pwallops are cyan variations of the Protobatter that Mario and Luigi encounter inside Bowser's body in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey. They are found in the Energy Hold.
In battle, Pwallops can spit out a yellow (cyan in the remake) ball that they use their clubs to send to a bro. If they have their eyes closed when they swing, they will miss and then immediately strike again. This attack is faster than the Protobatter's version and the attack must be countered with the hammer. If the Pwallop does a backhand swing, Mario is the target, but if they do an openhanded swing Luigi will be attacked. Pwallops also have a new attack where they slam the ground with their clubs, creating a shockwave that both Mario and Luigi must jump over. Like Protobatters, Pwallops grow in size when they take damage, increasing the strength of their attacks. They can only grow twice.
