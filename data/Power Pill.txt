The Power Pill is one of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's special items in Mario Kart Arcade GP.
Upon being used, the Power Pill will grant the user invincibility, as well as the ability to knock over any rival karts they run into, for five seconds. This item is functionally identical to the Star.
A variant of the item known as the Power Pill+ exists. This variant extends the duration of the invincibility.
In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Pac-Man summons a Power Pill (known as a Power Pellet in those games) during his side special move.
