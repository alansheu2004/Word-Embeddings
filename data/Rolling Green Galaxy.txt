The Rolling Green Galaxy is a galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy. In this golf course-like galaxy, Mario balances on a Rolling Ball and must maneuver the ball through the galaxy until he reaches a hole at the end of the galaxy that opens the ball, allowing him to get the Power Star. The music that plays here is the same music that is heard in the Sweet Sweet Galaxy, which is a variation of the athletic theme of Super Mario Bros. 3.
The name of this galaxy may be a play on a putting green, a part of a golf course, which this level resembles.

This planet is where the Rolling Ball can be found. When the player gets on top of it, they should move to a hole ahead of them, which will shoot them to the second Starting Planet. The second planet has some Goombas and Micro Goombas, and coins that surround a hole. When Mario goes into the hole, he will slide to the Rolling Green Planet.

Here, Mario must first carefully maneuver through the planet. There are many Goombas, narrow spaces, and big holes which he could easily fall into. There are also many coins, 1-Ups, and a few ? Coins he can collect. When Mario makes it to the field of flowers, the path splits into two. One path is easy with a few Goombas, the other path narrow but contains a ? Coin. At the end is another hole (on the easier path, Mario must jump to make it there), which shoots him to the final planet which has a hole that breaks the ball, releasing the Power Star. This planet also has a wind turbine and a flagpole that Mario must climb to reach the Power Star.

This galaxy consists of only the following mission.

The Rolling Green Galaxy appears in Mario Golf: World Tour, as well as Mario Sports Superstars, in the background of Rosalina's Eagle, Albatross, and Hole-in-One animations.
