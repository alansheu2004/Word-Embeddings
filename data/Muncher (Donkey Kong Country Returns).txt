Munchers are black spider hatchling enemies that appear in Donkey Kong Country Returns and Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D. They are implied by the scenery to be baby Skittlers. Munchers appear in large groups.
Munchers only appear in the Forest level, Muncher Marathon. Here, huge piles of muncher eggs are stored in large pots made of spider webs, with some outside on the wooden blocks, which can be bounced on. When Donkey Kong Ground Pounds on the first wooden block, destroying some of the eggs in the process, the eggs start to suddenly begin hatching simultaneously and a large group of munchers begins chasing after the Kongs. Munchers cannot be defeated, and the Kongs must avoid them or otherwise lose a heart from being hit, or be instantly defeated if caught in the wave of munchers in the back. The munchers make a screeching sound when they move toward the Kongs. The munchers chase Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong throughout the whole level up until the end. In the last part of the level, the Kongs must use Barrel Cannons to avoid the munchers moving up after them.
