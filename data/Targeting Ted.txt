Targeting Teds are enemies in New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Luigi U, and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. They are variants of Torpedo Teds, which they resemble, except Targeting Teds are red instead of black, have orange propellers, and are constantly spinning as they move. Much like Missile Bills, Targeting Teds follow the player character around until they explode. Targeting Teds are launched by red torpedo tubes and are one of the few enemies capable of destroying Empty Blocks. Players using Boost Mode with the Wii U GamePad can tap a Targeting Ted to make it explode.
In New Super Mario Bros. U, Targeting Teds appear in The Mighty Cannonship only, and Bowser Jr. also uses the Targeting Teds during his first fight at the level's end, where the players have to redirect them at Bowser Jr. three times to defeat him. In New Super Luigi U, Targeting Teds appear in Larry's Trigger-Happy Castle, as well as in Bowser Jr.'s first fight.
