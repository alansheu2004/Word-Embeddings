Gummits are enemies in Super Mario Galaxy 2. Gummits appear only in the missions The Chimp's Skating Challenge in the Freezy Flake Galaxy and The Chimp's Ultimate Skating Challenge in the Shiverburn Galaxy. In both missions, Gummits appear from small holes in the icy floor, and the player must skate over them (thereby knocking them out of their holes) to earn points. They seem to be based on Whack-a-Mole moles, and they have cheeks, snouts, and bellies like other moles in the Super Mario franchise.
Gummits come in three varieties: green Gummits, which are worth ten points each; Golden Gummits, which are worth 50 points each; and Spiky Gummits, which cause the player to fall backward and lose a few seconds, and are colored similarly to Urchins. Unlike other enemies, Gummits can be bumped into without taking any damage.
