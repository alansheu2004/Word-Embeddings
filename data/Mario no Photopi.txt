Mario no Photopi (マリオのふぉとぴー Mario no Fotopī, lit. "Mario's Photopi") is a creativity game for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, exclusively in Japan. The game is unique from other Super Mario games in that its cartridge has two slots for SmartMedia cards at the top, allowing for digital photos and other images to be imported and for transfer between the game and other devices.

The player can create unique images using a variety of artwork, borders, fonts, and other tools themed after the Super Mario franchise, similarly to Mario Paint. The images are edited or drawn using artwork, borders, fonts and other tools built into the game. While normal landscape images are supported, the layout can also be that of a postcard, poster, or slideshow. These images can then be used in dedicated minigames, such as a sliding puzzle where the player must swap tiles to form an image they have drawn.
The two SmartMedia card slots also allow for images to be swapped between the game and any other SmartMedia device, such as a PC or camera. Finished drawings can be transferred to  PC or a printer.
Nine SmartMedia cards were made exclusively for optional use with the game. They contain pre-drawn images themed after Nintendo and other franchises, including The Legend of Zelda, Yoshi, and Bomberman.
