Bald Clefts are a type of Cleft without spikes on their heads that appears in the Paper Mario series.

Bald Clefts first appear in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door as well as its Nintendo Switch remake. They can be found on pedestals on the path leading to Shhwonk Fortress during Chapter 1, and attack by charging at Mario and his partners. After that, there is no way to refight this enemy, making it the only one-time enemy to be unrelated to the X-Nauts.
Due to their lack of spikes, they are safe to jump on, although they still have a high amount of defence relative to most other enemies, especially the ones found near them. This can be negated by flipping them upside-down, much like normal Clefts. Fire elements, including a Fire Flower, do not damage them since their hides are compressed of rock. A POW Block defeats them easily.

Bald Clefts appear again in Super Paper Mario as enemies in the Yold Desert. Like their relatives, they disguise themselves as rocks and reveal their true form when a hero gets close enough. They attack the same way as they did in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. However, the Super Paper Mario variety is not as tough as their other Paper Mario counterparts, as they can easily be defeated with Boomer. None can flip dimensions. They appear in the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials in rooms 13, 34, and 71.
