Bob-omb Blitz is a Brawl Attack usable by Bowser in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey. Once Bowser frees the Bob-ombs from a cage in Bowser Castle, Bob-omb Blitz can be utilized in battle for twelve SP in the original, and eighteen BP (twenty BP on Easy) in the 3DS remake. After tossing the spherical pile of Bob-ombs off-screen when the move starts, the player must use the  to line the Bob-ombs up with the enemies before the move ends. Once lined up, the Bob-ombs will walk towards the enemy, and will explode on them, possibly dealing multiple hits. If the Bob-ombs hit the same enemy, the enemy will possibly become dizzy. If the player lines them up in the wrong place, they will run past the enemies and blow up nothing. In the original version, Bowser roars to send the Bob-ombs. In the remake, he uses a whistle instead.
