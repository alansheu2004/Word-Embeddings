Stones are blocks exclusive to certain Story Mode levels in Super Mario Maker 2. They are rare, heavy blocks that can be picked up and thrown, allowing Mario to defeat enemies. While being carried, they also weigh Mario down, causing his jumps to be one block high. In all levels where Stones appear, one must be carried to the goal in order to clear the level.
Stones can be thrown at enemies to squash and defeat them. Yoshi can carry Stones in his mouth; however, this slows him down. Despite its weight, Mario will still float to the surface of water if he carries a Stone while swimming, as with any holdable item.
Stones appear in all game styles but the original Super Mario Bros. style, as Mario cannot carry objects in that style. The Ver. 3.0.0 update has since added the SMB2 Mushroom, which would allow Mario to carry items in the original Super Mario Bros. style. However, Story Mode was never updated since the game was first released, so Stones remain absent.
Yellow Toad gives Mario three jobs where he must retrieve Stones. Afterwards, he sculpts them each into a Goomba, a Cheep Cheep, and a green Koopa Troopa in their Super Mario Bros. styles.
