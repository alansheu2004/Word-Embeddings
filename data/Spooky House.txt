Spooky House is a world in Mario vs. Donkey Kong and its remake. It is the fourth world in the original version and the fifth world in the remake. True to its name, it is set in a haunted mansion. It introduces Polterguys, which turn into blocks when Mario steps on a switch of their color. New enemies introduced in this world include Thwomps, Thwimps, Boos, Sir Shovalots, and Candles.

Exclusively in the Nintendo Switch version of Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a bonus level that appears after completing enough levels in this world. The layout strongly resembles the first area of Level 5-5, although altered with gaps in some of the top portions of the layout and two semisolid platforms placed like stairs towards the upper left portion. Some 1-Up Mushrooms are put in place of what would've been the key and the Color Switch in the original layout. Like in most bonus levels, the player simply needs to catch the flying key and bring it to the chest to successfully complete it.
