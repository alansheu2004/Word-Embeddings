Bruto is a biker appearing in the Saturday Supercade episode "Banana Bikers."
He first appears with his gang members, driving away from the police on motorcycles. After escaping from them, they stop at the Big Banana Malt Shop. At the shop, Bruto mentions that his gang needs new members. After seeing Donkey Kong, he remarks that he would be the perfect to get back at Pleasant Bluff's sheriff and asks him to join his gang with the promise of bananas.
At the sheriff's office, Bruto calls for the sheriff. The sheriff attempts to arrest him and his gang, but when he sees Donkey Kong, he becomes scared. After Donkey Kong traps him and his deputies in a jail cell, Bruto takes him on a "shopping spree" at the local general store. During the "spree," when looking for Pauline under some mannequins after Mario knocks them over, Donkey Kong accidentally tosses her into Bruto's hands, and he and his gang escape.
He later appears when Donkey Kong jumps onto his motorcycle from some power lines, where he grabs him and Pauline and tosses the former onto his other members' motorcycle. It crashes into Mario's net trap, sending them back into Pleasant Bluff's sheriff office, destroying the office in the process. Bruto is last seen in a jail cell with his other members.
