Lakitu Kings are enemies that appear in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story and its remake, Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey. They appear as Lakitus with a gold crown (with globes on the pointed tips in the remake), a gold shell and gold stars on their cloud. The Lakitu King only appears in battle on the top screen when Bowser encounters a Flifit. It has a stronger variant known as the Glam Lakitu.

Bowser must inhale the Lakitu King using the Vacuum Block, allowing Mario and Luigi to battle it. The Lakitu King will attack by throwing golden Spiny Eggs at the Mario Bros., along with some coins. If the Lakitu King throws the item overhand, it will be bounce off the ground and above them. If the Mario Bros. do not defeat the Lakitu King within a few turns, it will escape, causing Bowser to cough it up before it flies away.
In Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey, Lakitu Kings are found as enemies in the Bowser Jr.'s Journey mode. Lakitu Kings are flying troopers, and they are strong against Spinies and weak against Captain Shy Guy.
