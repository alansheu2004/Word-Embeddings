Electrogeddon is a Spark that appears in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. It is located in Palette Prime, in the Darkmess Tentacle battle Roots of Corruption. After the battle, Electrogeddon joins the heroes on their adventure.
In battle, Electrogeddon's ability is Skyrain Shock, which causes electrified meteors to fall around the Hero, dealing damage, damaging cover, and causing the Shock Super Effect. Electrogeddon can be upgraded by feeding it Star Bits, which increases the attack power of the meteors. Its passive ability is Shock Protector, which decreases the damage received by Super Effects and makes the Hero resistant to the Shock Super Effect. When upgraded, the Super Effect damage is lessened even more.
Electrogeddon is a yellow Spark (a color slightly lighter than Starburst) riding a cloud with a lightning bolt sticking out of the back end. Electrogeddon's name is a combination of the words "electric" and "Armageddon". Its appearance, cloud, and ability are similar to Pyrogeddon, Cryogeddon and Vampgeddon.
