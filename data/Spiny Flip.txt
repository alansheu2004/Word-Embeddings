Spiny Flip is Lakilester's default attack in the game Paper Mario. It does not cost any FP. In order to execute the attack, the player must aim the cursor with the Control Stick () at the enemy's hitbox within the time limit. Once the limit is up, Lakilester will throw a Spiny Egg at the cursor, either dealing damage to the enemy if the cursor was well-aligned, or missing in case the cursor was misaligned. The player can also press  to preemptively finish the move. When successfully executed, Spiny Flip inflicts three points of damage to an enemy at Base Rank, four points at Super Rank, and five at Ultra Rank. Both it and Shell Toss are the only initial attacks from partners in the game that always avoid taking contact damage from the enemy.
As a mini-boss, Lakilester's Spiny Flip inflicts four points of damage to Mario, but goes down to three once he joins his party.
