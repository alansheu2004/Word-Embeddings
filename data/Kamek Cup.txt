The Kamek Cup is one of the cups in Mario Kart Tour. The cup first appeared during the Kamek Tour, when Kamek was made available in the game as a playable character. The cup returned in later tours, despite Kamek not being obtainable in most, until he was made available in regular pipes starting from the Battle Tour, essentially making this the first cup to represent a character who was tour-exclusive when the cup was introduced. Courses in this cup are treated as Kamek's favored or favorite courses.
Prior to Mario Kart Tour, a cup titled the Kamek Cup also appears in Super Mario Party as part of Mariothon. It has Gridiron Gauntlet, Fuzzy Flight School, Snack Attack, Croozin' for a Broozin', and a randomly chosen minigame.
