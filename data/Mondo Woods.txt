Mondo Woods is a location from Paper Mario: Color Splash. The path leading here is unlocked after getting the green Mini Paint Star in Ch√¢teau Chanterelle, and unlocks paths leading to Sacred Forest and Dark Bloo Inn. The woods have been enlarged, which is later revealed as the work of Kamek, who is using his magic to enlarge all of the forest and the Goombas.

Mario and Huey must visit here to find Prof. Kinopio, who has went for a walk with Princess. A nearby Toad says that he has seen the professor walk past. Shortly afterwards, Huey notices a Mega Goomba and realizes that the forest has grown in size. Mario must hammer two Brick Blocks to reveal a path deeper into the forest. If Mario breaks more blocks in the next area, he can go north and observe Kamek enlarging a Goomba. The Goomba blocks a platform, and Mario must go across the platform and then jump down to defeat the Goomba.
After crossing the platform and going to the next area, Mario and Huey will find a Chain Chomp chain on the ground. The professor is sitting on a block nearby. Once Mario destroys the block, he confirms that he is the professor and is sad over Princess having run away. Huey suggests that Princess went home, and the professor cheers up, promising to give them a permit if they return to his house. To get the green Mini Paint Star nearby, Mario must walk behind a tree. Getting the Paint Star in this level unlocks access to Sacred Forest.
After getting the yellow Big Paint Star, a giant color-drained coin will be filled in, allowing Mario to grab it and get the blue Mini Paint Star behind it that leads to Dark Bloo Inn.
