Kamek's Revenge is the Extra Stage of World 5 in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Throughout the level, Kamek will try to attack Yoshi and knock Baby Mario off him. Some Green Gloves also attempt to knock Yoshi off of the many log platforms. Like every other Extra Stage, this level's playable Yoshi is the green Yoshi.
In the second part of the level, the area starts out with a hut that Yoshi must enter. However, this hut requires a key, which is found in the first area. After entering the hut, Yoshi will then exit it, and be equipped with skis. During that time, Yoshi will ride the skis down a mountain while having to avoid Kamek. In the third part, he has to ski but this time he has to ski in the clouds rather than in the snow. The skiing part of this course is considerably more difficult and longer than of that in Danger - Icy Conditions Ahead. Next, Yoshi turns into a helicopter and must travel through the rest of the level while avoiding Kamek, Green Gloves, and some Bumpties. Yoshi must get to the Yoshi Block on time here, because if he is not quick enough to hit it, he will lose a life due to the lack of ground under the helicopter bubble. After getting through this section, Yoshi turns back into a dinosaur and reaches the Goal Ring.
