The Boards in the Super Mario Galaxy games are four talking signposts. In Super Mario Galaxy, they exclaim, "Hey!" at Mario before telling him how to perform a particular move each time he meets them. Some Boards appear in multiple locations, but their ability to transport themselves is not explored. The names of all four are puns on "billboard." One of the Boards also appears in Super Mario Galaxy 2 with the same role as in the first game.
There are passive, non-sentient signs in both games that look identical to these Boards.

Gil Board is the first of the Boards to be encountered. He is a signpost that tells Mario how to wall-jump. He claims to be the "famous Gil Board" and claims Mario knows him, although Super Mario Galaxy is the first appearance in which he has been specifically named. His only appearance is in the Honeyhive Galaxy.

Bill Board is the second Board encountered and the Board with the most appearances. He teaches Mario how to roll on the Star Ball in the Rolling Green Galaxy, Melty Molten Galaxy, and Rolling Gizmo Galaxy. He also makes an appearance at the celebration in the Grand Finale Galaxy. Here, he tells Mario that he lives in a nice world, and that he would be able to enjoy it more if he were not a sign.
In Super Mario Galaxy 2, Bill Board appears in the Rolling Masterpiece Galaxy, once again teaching Mario how to roll on the Star Ball. He is the only one of the four Boards to reappear.

Phil Board is the third Board encountered. He teaches Mario how to move when he is in a bubble. He appears in the Bubble Breeze Galaxy and Bubble Blast Galaxy.

Jill Board is the fourth and final Board to be encountered. Her only appearance is in Boo's Boneyard Galaxy, in which she reminds the player of the Boo Mario controls. If Mario speaks to Jill Board while he is in his normal form, Jill Board states she talks only to Boos, and tells Mario to go away.
