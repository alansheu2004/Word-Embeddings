The Dolphin Great Sail is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the Vacation Tour, this glider is a yellow and blue variant of the Great Sail that features the Super Marine World and Toad Harbor logos on its sails. Unlike the Great Sail, this glider improves the chances of obtaining Green Shells from Item Boxes and increases the number of bonus points earned for hitting other drivers with a Green Shell.

The Dolphin Great Sail is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it does not currently appear in the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows this kart's availability by tour.
