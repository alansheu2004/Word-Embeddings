Jerusalem (Arabic: القُدس, al-Quds; Hebrew: יְרוּשָׁלַיִם, Yerushaláyim) is a city in West Asia claimed by both the State of Israel and the State of Palestine as their capital city. Luigi visits it in the PC version of Mario is Missing!, in which it appears in the final set of levels. Despite the long-running dispute between Israel and Palestine over the city's territorial status, the game lists the entire city as Israeli.
As with all other cities in the game, Jerusalem was invaded by Koopa Troopas sent by Bowser. The Troopas stole artifacts from various landmarks of the city: the Dome of the Rock from the Islamic shrine of the same name, a brick from the Western Wall, the Damascus Gate, and the Dead Sea Scrolls from the Shrine of the Book. Mayor Bernstein tasked Luigi with finding all the artifacts and returning them to their respective landmarks.
