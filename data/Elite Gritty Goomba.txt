An Elite Gritty Goomba is an enemy that appears in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and its remake, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. They are a stronger version of the Gritty Goomba, and can be found in Gwarhar Lagoon. In the original game, they were simply called Gritty Goombas, just like their weaker counterpart; the remake gives them their current name.

Elite Gritty Goombas can summon sandstorms much like their base counterparts, using them as a cover while trying to run into Mario and Luigi, who must counter with their hammers. Unlike regular Gritty Goombas, when one of the Elite Gritty Goombas performs their attack, it is harder to determine which brother it is targeting before attempting to ram him.
