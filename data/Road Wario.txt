Road Wario is Kat & Ana's boss microgame in WarioWare: Smooth Moves, where it is known as Driver's Ed, and Wario's boss microgame of the Intro Games stage from the Twist League in WarioWare Gold, where it features Wario driving the Wario Car. Its name in Gold is a play on the term "road warrior."

The objective of the microgame is to drive to the finish line by tilting the Wii Remote or the Nintendo 3DS system like a steering wheel. The driver however, is surrounded by large forests and trees, so it is vital to stay on the road at all times. Animals, such as cows, monkeys, and birds can also be found on the road, but they run away shortly before the player passes through them, therefore providing a mere distraction. If the player makes it to the end of the track safely, the driver will give the rear view mirror a thumbs-up (with the text "Good job!" appearing) and the game is won. However, the player hits any tree, the car will crash (with the text "Totaled..." appearing on-screen in international versions and "Failure..." in the Japanese version) and the game ends in a loss.

The player can press the  or  button to sound the horn, although it has no impact on the gameplay. However, this is only possible in WarioWare: Smooth Moves, making it no longer possible in WarioWare Gold.
In WarioWare Gold, the top screen shows a top-down view of the road. Also, there is no text appearing if the player wins or loses.
