The Para-Wing is a kart from the Mario Kart series. It is based on the Koopa Dasher, with a red color scheme and wings on the side, resembling a Koopa Paratroopa. It also has Ps replacing all the Ks.

The Para-Wing first appears in Mario Kart: Double Dash!! as the signature kart of Paratroopa. It is a lightweight kart unlocked by winning the Star Cup on 50cc. The Para-Wing has very low top speed along with very high acceleration, being tied with the Goo-Goo Buggy and Toadette Kart in both categories. Like the Koopa Dasher, it is slightly heavier than other lightweight karts, being able to rival the weight of the medium-weight Bloom Coach. However, the kart is more prone to bouncing than the Goo-Goo Buggy and Toadette Kart. The kart's wings move when it boosts.

The Para-Wing returns in Mario Kart Tour as a Super kart. Unlike before, the P has been replaced with the respective driver's emblem, the platform is absent, and its wings no longer move. It uses the Turbo Yoshi's tires, although an unused sprite shows it with the Pipe Frame's tires, similar to what the Koopa Dasher originally used. The Para-Wing increases the duration of Jump Boost speed boosts and the number of points earned for performing Jump Boosts.
A disco ball-themed variant called the Party-Wing debuted in the New Year's 2021 Tour and is classified as a High-End kart.
