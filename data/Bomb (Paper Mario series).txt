Bomb is an attack that can be used by Bombette in Paper Mario that costs three FP to use. As the player rapidly taps  in order to fill an on-screen gauge, Bombette walks up to the frontmost grounded enemy and explodes, damaging the enemy. Her attack can also be used outside of battle to activate switches, or destroy cracked walls.
In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Bobbery uses Bomb as his default attack, which costs no FP. To perform the move in this game, the player has to hold down  and let go when a red light appears on the screen. However, unique to this move, failing the Action Command will not trigger audience dissatisfaction and will generate the same amount of Star Power as succeeding. The Bomb attack will also clear away fog during a battle.
A Stylish move can be executed by pressing  when Bobbery lands after exploding. Outside of battle, it involves Mario tossing Bobbery upwards, so he can destroy cracked walls and activate otherwise unreachable switches.
Both Bombette and Bobbery can perform this attack as a First Strike, in which case the Action Command will be automatically performed and FP will not be consumed. Bobbery's Bomb First Strike can ground Parabuzzies and Spiky Parabuzzies, even if they take no damage from the attack.
Both Bomb attacks are imbued with the "explosion" element, allowing them to deal more damage (i.e., Pyro Guys, Lava Bubbles, and Dry Bones) or none at all (i.e., Buzzy Beetles) to certain enemies, flip over foes like Hyper Clefts and Moon Clefts, and make bomb and bullet-type enemies (i.e., Bob-ombs, Bulky Bob-ombs, and Bullet Bills) explode and defeat themselves instantly.
