The Gold Bunny is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2022 Yoshi Tour. As its name indicates, it is a gold variant of the Bright Bunny. Unlike the Bright Bunny, it uses the Gold Blooper's tires. Also unlike the Bright Bunny, this kart increases the duration of Slipstream boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Slipstream.

The Gold Bunny is not obtainable from regular pipes, and it is not a part of the Daily Selects set. However, it has been included in the Daily Spotlight lineup for every tour from the Battle Tour to the 2024 rerun of the Ninja Tour. The table below shows the kart's special availability by tour.
