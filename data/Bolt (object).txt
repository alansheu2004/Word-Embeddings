Bolts (also known as plugs or rivets) are objects in Donkey Kong. There are eight (six in the Game Boy version) orange bolts that are worth 100 points each. Mario has to destroy them to complete the level, which can be done by either walking over a bolt or jumping across it. Once every bolt is removed, the platforms supporting Donkey Kong collapse, allowing Mario to rescue Pauline. Removing a bolt also creates a gap that Fires cannot cross. If a bolt is removed while a Fire is on top of it, the Fire becomes stuck over the gap. This allows Mario to safely jump over the Fire repeatedly to gain points.

Bolts are objects in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, too. Bolts on level B1 of DK's Hideout can be removed by Mini Marios from either walking over, jumping across, or standing on top of one, which then melts away and disappears. Removing the bolts is required to defeat Donkey Kong in a manner similarly to 100m in Donkey Kong.
