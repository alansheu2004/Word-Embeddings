The Leaf Cup is a cup in the Mario Kart series, introduced in Mario Kart DS as the seventh cup in that game. It exclusively features classic courses, and is the third retro cup overall. The Leaf Cup usually contains courses from the Flower Cup and Star Cup of previous games, with some occasional Special Cup courses, though it features a sole course from Mario Kart: Super Circuit's Lightning Cup in Mario Kart DS (GBA Luigi Circuit), and a sole Mushroom Cup course from Mario Kart 64 in Mario Kart 7 (N64 Kalimari Desert). The Leaf Cup is slightly more difficult when compared to the Banana Cup, akin to the Star Cup. The cup's emblem is a Super Leaf, though its design was changed starting with Mario Kart 7 to match its redesign from Super Mario 3D Land.

Winning the Leaf Cup in the Mario Kart series can award the player with various bonuses, depending on the game. Additional cups unlocked are excluded from this list.

Most unlockable characters in Mario Kart 8 are unlocked at random upon winning Grand Prix cups (separate cups must be played to unlock characters), which includes the Leaf Cup. Characters that can be unlocked include Rosalina, Metal Mario, Lakitu, Toadette, Baby Rosalina, Pink Gold Peach, Iggy Koopa, Roy Koopa, Lemmy Koopa, Larry Koopa, Wendy O. Koopa, Ludwig von Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr., and Mii. Mii is unlocked upon the eighth Grand Prix cup victory, unless an amiibo is used to unlock Mii beforehand.
In addition, the Gold Standard body can be unlocked by getting a 1 star rank or higher on all non-DLC cups (including the Leaf Cup) on any one engine class, and the 150cc Mirror class can be unlocked by winning all 150cc cups.

"The Leaf Cup takes us back to some tracks that are definitely fan favorites. Go retro while you find shortcuts at DS Desert Hills, avoid the giant Thwomps at GBA Bowser Castle 3, blast over the river at N64 DK's Jungle Parkway, and fake out the Chain Chomp at GCN Mario Circuit."
