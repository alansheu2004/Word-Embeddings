The Yellow Sub Scooter is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour that was introduced in the Sunshine Tour as the signature kart of Toadette (Sailor). It is a kart based on a yellow submarine with black guard rails, an orange steering wheel and seat, and claws in front of each air tank, on which the emblems are located. The Yellow Sub Scooter uses the Cheep Snorkel's tires and increases the duration of Slipstream speed boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Slipstream.
The Yellow Sub Scooter has a blue variant that debuted alongside it called the Blue Sub Scooter, which is also designated as a High-End kart.

The Yellow Sub Scooter is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it does not currently appear in the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows this kart's availability by tour.
