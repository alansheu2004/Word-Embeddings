Shroom City is a large island in Mario Party Advance split into different areas, including one set on smaller, separate islands.
After the player finishes making their passport, they meet Toad, who tells them about all of the fun activities in Party World. Suddenly, Bowser and Koopa Kid drop in and squish Toad, scattering Gaddgets and minigames all over Shroom City. After they leave, Toad tells the player to collect the missing Gaddgets and minigames from Shroom City's locals.
In Shroom City mode, are fifty quests for the player to solve in order to get a Gaddget from a citizen or a minigame from Bowser. Bowser can only be confronted after a certain numbers of quests are completed, after which he will allow passage through one of the pipes, letting the player confront him. Once all the citizens' quests are complete, the Pipe House can be visited to confront Bowser for the final time.
