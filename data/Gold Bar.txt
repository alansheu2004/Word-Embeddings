Gold Bars (or gold bars) are items seen in a few games of the Super Mario franchise.

Gold Bars first appear in Luigi's Mansion. They account for 100,000G each and are often found in Treasure Chests.
Gold Bars return in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon and Luigi's Mansion 3, once again being a collectible treasure item. However, they are worth only 20G instead of 100,000G. They are also much more common and can appear after Luigi vacuums a ghost or flashes a gold spider, gold mouse, gold bat, gold beetle, or Gold Robomb with the Strobulb.

Gold Bars are also used for storing money in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario. Mario cannot use them in combat in any way, and he can only sell them for coins. In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Gold Bars are sold at Deepdown Depot, where they can be sold back for 100 coins. In the Nintendo Switch remake, they can be sold for 101 coins at Toad Bros. Bazaar, 105 coins at Westside Goods, also 105 coins at Niff T.'s shop, 110 coins at Northwinds Mart, 112 coins at Pungent's Great Tree Shop, or 130 coins at the Sales Stall.
In Super Paper Mario, Mario can give a Golden Leaf to Saffron to turn it into a Gold Bar and a Gold Bar into a Golden Meal, a useless item worth 50 coins (as opposed to the Gold Bar, which is worth up to 120 coins) players can make if they ever find themselves having too much money.
