The Firefly is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Amsterdam Tour as a reward for placing high in ranked cups. The kart is a yellow variant of the Dragonfly, including the tires, and with a strong resemblance to its counterpart, the Dozer Dasher. Unlike the Dragonfly, this kart increases the duration of Rocket Start boosts and the number of points earned for performing a Rocket Start.

Starting with the Battle Tour, the Firefly is available in regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. However, it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects lineup.
