Jack O'Goombas (also formatted as Jack O' Goombas), originally referred to as Pumpkinhead Goombas, are enemies found in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. These enemies are Goombas that wear pumpkins over their heads. The enemies' name and appearance are derived from jack-o'-lanterns.

Pumpkinhead Goombas made their debut in Super Mario Galaxy. They can be found in the Ghostly Galaxy. They are capable of producing small blue flames in an attempt to burn Mario (or Luigi), yet the ability is lost when their pumpkins are destroyed. To break their jack-o'-lantern helmets, Mario must spin. Ground-pounding a Pumpkinhead Goomba, however, destroys both the pumpkin helmet and the Goomba in one pound. Once the Pumpkinhead Goomba loses its pumpkin cover, it is simply a regular Goomba. If the player ground-pounds a Pumpkinhead Goomba after it just produced a blue flame, Mario will get burned if he touches it. Also, if one tries to jump on one, the pumpkin will not break. If Mario runs into a Pumpkinhead Goomba as Rainbow Mario, only the pumpkin will break.
Pumpkinhead Goombas, along with other enemies, can be seen dancing with Toads in the center of Toad Town during the game's ending.

Jack O'Goombas later reappear under their current name in Super Mario Galaxy 2. They have not changed much from the predecessor, still wearing pumpkin masks, releasing blue flames once in a while. These enemies are not limited to haunted galaxies, being found in such places as the Clockwork Ruins Galaxy.

While Jack O'Goombas do not appear in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the giant pumpkins that appear during the Wonder Effect in the course Upshroom Downshroom have carved faces that look exactly like those of the pumpkins they wear.
