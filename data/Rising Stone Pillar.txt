Rising Stone Pillars are solid objects that appear in the Lost Kingdom in Super Mario Odyssey. Each one occurs as a pair of columns connected by stairs, with both pillars having a starburst-shaped symbol on them. One pillar is always higher than the other. Performing a Ground Pound on the elevated pillar slams it into the ground and causes the other pillar to rise. They appear to be made out of the same stones as Propeller Pillars and are etched with similar markings.
After Mario arrives at the Lost Kingdom, striking a Rising Stone Pillar is needed to knock-out Klepto, who has taken Cappy. A Power Moon for an objective called Chasing Klepto in the Moon Pipe subarea can be obtained the same way. Rising Stone Pillars are otherwise found throughout the Lost Kingdom and can be used to reach higher areas. One of the Rising Stone Pillars is hollow and contains a Power Moon.
