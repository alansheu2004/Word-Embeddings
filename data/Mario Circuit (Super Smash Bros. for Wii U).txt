Mario Circuit is a stage in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It is based on Mario Circuit from Mario Kart 8. Similar to other traveling stages such as Rainbow Road, Mario Circuit primarily takes place on moving platforms, stopping at various points on the course itself. The stage often stops at certain points in the anti-gravity section of the course where the track itself is not the main fighting ground, such as when the track is on its side in the background, or as part of the stage (serving as a wall), and when it is upside down (serving as a ceiling). Shy Guys in karts appear as stage hazards in Mario Circuit, like other Mario Kart-themed stages in the series. A prompt appears for when Shy Guys are approaching, and also for when the main platform starts to move again. The Î© form takes place on the touring platform lacking pass-through platform above it and cannot be passed through from below; the platform also does not stop at a particular location, and Shy Guys do not appear.
