Undergrunts are enemies in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. These large moles appear to be militaristic Montys: Undergrunt refers to a low rank, while Major Burrows and Undergrunt Gunners also use military terms in their names. They slightly resemble early depictions of Monty Moles due to their light-colored cheeks and rounded snouts, but have large eyes, toothy grins, and yellow camo-plated helmets, the last of which is the only thing of them visible while they dig.

In Super Mario Galaxy, Undergrunts appear in Gusty Garden Galaxy in the mission The Dirty Tricks of Major Burrows as uncommon enemies on two planets. Even though the Undergrunts' helmets lack spikes on the top (though they do have spikes on the sides), Mario or Luigi cannot safely jump on them. However, Undergrunts can be defeated by Ground Pounding near them, then spinning them after they have popped out. They give a coin when defeated. Undergrunts also appear in Gold Leaf Galaxy.
Blue Undergrunts on a cannon, called Undergrunt Gunners, appear in the Gold Leaf Galaxy, the Deep Dark Galaxy and the Toy Time Galaxy.
At the end of Gusty Garden Galaxy, there is the boss of this galaxy, Major Burrows, who is the leader of the Undergrunts and can be defeated in almost the same way.

Only two normal Undergrunts appear in Super Mario Galaxy 2 on the Undergrunt Planet in Battle Belt Galaxy. They are defeated the same way as in the previous game. However, they give three Star Bits instead of a coin when defeated. Undergrunt Gunners have now become a much more common enemy species.
In addition, Major Burrows reappears in Boss Blitz Galaxy.
