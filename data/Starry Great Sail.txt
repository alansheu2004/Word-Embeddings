The Starry Great Sail is a High-End glider appearing in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the Aprilâ€“May 2021 Sydney Tour, the glider is a variant of the Great Sail with a pale blue mast and pink and purple sails with stars printed on them. Unlike the Great Sail, this glider increases the chances of getting Lightning from Item Boxes and the number of bonus points awarded for landing hits with Lightning.

Starting from the Penguin Tour, the Starry Great Sail can be obtained from regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. It is not currently part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's special availability by tour.
