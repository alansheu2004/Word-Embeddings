Goombeetles, also known as Octobeetles, are a type of Goomba only found in Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel Super Mario Galaxy 2. They are Goombas that wear protective helmets, which prevent them from being stomped on. Their name is derived from the Buzzy Beetles. They are sometimes described as being robotic Goombas. Goombeetles behave identically in both appearances.
In Super Mario Galaxy, Goombeetles are found mostly found in Bowser's and Bowser Jr.'s galaxies. They are also found in the Buoy Base Galaxy and the Dreadnought Galaxy. They attack by charging at Mario, just as regular Goombas. However, unlike regular Goombas, they cannot be defeated by being jumped on due to their helmets. To defeat them, Mario must flip them with a spin and then jump on them. Each one defeated releases a coin. If instead they are defeated with a Bullet Bill, they will release three Star Bits.
In Super Mario Galaxy 2, Goombeetles can be found in Bowser Jr.'s Fiery Flotilla, Beat Block Galaxy and Chompworks Galaxy. They can be defeated by the Co-Star Luma or instantly defeated by a Chomp, which, like the previous game, causes them to release three Star Bits.
