Hobgoblins are undead enemies that inhabit Kero Sewers in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and its remake. Their name refers to a type of household spirit in English folklore, which would pull pranks on citizens and do work around the house. They wear ragged clothing and carry lanterns, making them resemble the Lantern Ghosts from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. Hobgoblins also slightly resemble scarecrows. These enemies never fight by themselves; they always accompany other enemies like Rat Funks, Boo or Shadow.
In battle, Hobgoblins attack by clawing their opponents. Additionally, Hobgoblins can use a number of magic spells that cause status ailments. One such attack is Dark Claw, which Poisons one of Mario's allies and causes 50% more damage than their normal claw attack. The other is Elegy, which Mutes a party member, making them unable to perform special attacks. Since they are undead, Hobgoblins can be instantly destroyed with Pure Water.
More powerful variants of Hobogoblins known as Straw Heads are found in the Sunken Ship.
