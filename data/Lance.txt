Lances are blade obstacles that rest in one place, usually along the ceiling, thrusting up and down in a set rhythm. They usually are deployed in narrow places with not much room for evasion to ensure difficulty for the player to progress. Functionally, they are comparable to Skewers, albeit much smaller than they usually are.

In Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, lances appear in Turtle Zone, looking like a simple long, thin knife. Fewer of them appear in Easy Mode. They can be defeated by running into them while the player is invincible. In the Whale Course, they are colored white and appear to be organic, but function exactly the same.

In Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, lances appear in Syrup Castle. They appear as low-hanging, axe-like blades that constantly jiggle up and down, though their collision remains approximately block-sized. Small Wario can simply walk underneath them, but if larger, Wario will have to crouch and crawl underneath them. Jet Wario can also fly through them if launched on the floor.

Lances are encountered in several levels of Wario Land II. They are composed of a blade resembling the version of the lance from the previous game, but are attached to a metal pole with some wire wrapped around it, and produce an alarming sound when moving. While the edged part of the lance itself can hurt Wario and throw him backward, the pole is harmless and can be passed without taking damage. Some lances even have Conveyor Belts underneath them.
