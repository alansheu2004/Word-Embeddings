Whimsical Waters is one of the five boards in Mario Party 10. It is set in an underwater lagoon. Dragoneels appear on the board and have their own minigame where players need to choose a chest. The mid-boss fort is Mega Cheep Chomp, while the castle at the end leads to a fight with Mega Blooper. This is the only board where both the bosses are both in mega form. Most of the board's gimmicks have to do with Dragoneel and Underwater events.
The board is mostly the same in Bowser Party mode, albeit with the usual gameplay changes. However, in both the Dragoneel minigames and the ink-obscured path branches, Bowser gets to see the contents of each chest/the spaces on each path before using the GamePad to try and misdirect his opponents with stamps and drawings.

Whimsical Waters begins with a couple of turns on an underwater path. The first Dragoneel Treasure area is on that path. Afterwards, there are two separate paths, which is determined by a wheel with a Cheep Cheep statue on it. The one on the left is a path with another Dragoneel Treasure, and the one on the right leads to a path with Unlucky Spaces and Mini Ztars. After that comes a path with two Dragoneel Treasures and the Mid-Boss area.
After the mid-boss, the submarine goes down into another path with more Dragoneel Treasure. Then two more paths with the Cheep Cheep wheel appear, with the one upwards having Lucky Spaces and Mini Stars, and the one below it having Unlucky Spaces and Mini Ztars. Then the two paths combine and follow up with another Dragoneel Treasure, which follows to a ring with a Toad House and Dragoneel Spaces. Afterwards is a gate in which the player must roll a 4 or higher to get past it; if the player fails, they must make another lap, and the gate becomes automatically passable. The player who passes through the gate will receive five Mini Stars. After that comes the Homestretch, two more Dragoneel Treasures, and then the end of the board.
