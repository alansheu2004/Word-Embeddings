The Star-Spangled Glider is a High-End glider that appears in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2020 Los Angeles Tour, and it became the signature glider of Mario (Sunshine) in the 2021 Los Angeles Tour, Mario (Santa) in the 2021 Holiday Tour, and Chargin' Chuck in the 2022 Los Angeles Tour. The glider is a red, white and blue variant of the Starchute, sharing a similar color scheme to the Star-Spangled Flyer. Unlike the Starchute, this glider increases the chances of getting Mega Mushrooms from Item Boxes  and the amount of points awarded for crashing drivers while under the effects of one.
