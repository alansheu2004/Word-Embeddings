The Super Hammer is an item appearing in Super Mario Maker 2, exclusively in the Super Mario 3D World style, unlocked after clearing the Meowser Showdown! level in Story Mode. Picking one up transforms the character into their Builder form, allowing them to use a hammer to break Hard Blocks, as well as Thwomps, and any other breakable object, and place down up to five Builder Boxes at a time, which act like Crates. The hammer can also be used to defeat most enemies, which even includes Boos and Peepas. However, it has no effect against Big Ant Troopers. In Multiplayer Versus mode, the Super Hammer can be used to knock back other players.
The Super Hammer also appears in The Super Mario Bros. Movie as an icon around construction areas.
