Cooks, also referred to as Syrup chefs, are enemies in Wario Land II. These small, pink moles wear a white chef hat and a white apron and move around while carrying pieces of cake on long forks in certain levels, most commonly within indoor areas. A Cook throws its cake if Wario is nearby before running away.
Derived enemies known as Doughnuteers appeared in Wario Land 3. They behave nearly identically, but look different, noticeably wearing pants in favor of toques, throw doughnuts rather than cake, and do not pause as long. They share their status as a source of the Fat Wario form with Applebies in Wario Land 3, and were replaced by the similar RingosukÄ« in Wario Land 4.
