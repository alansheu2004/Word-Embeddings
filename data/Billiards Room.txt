The Billiards Room is a location found in the third area of Luigi's Mansion.
Slim Bankshot resides in this room. Luigi can capture Slim Bankshot with the Poltergust 3000, causing the lights to come on and a green treasure chest to appear. 

The Billiards Room's main point of interest is obviously the pool table. There is also a dartboard, a chess set, and two small drawers. This room is also one of only two rooms with a ceiling fan, the other being the Master Bedroom. There is a Speedy Spirit in the chair at the southeast corner of the room. However, it can only be caught when Slim is present.
