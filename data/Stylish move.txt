Stylish moves, also referred to as Stylish commands, are extra commands in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario that accompany every attack in the game. It is up to Mario, Goombella, Koops, Flurrie, the Yoshi Kid, Vivian, Admiral Bobbery, and Ms. Mowz to use these moves by themselves. When Stylish moves are executed, the crowd in front of the battle stage becomes even more wild, providing more Star Power than a normal Action Command to use for special moves. Some attacks have multiple Stylish moves.
To do a Stylish move, the player must press  at a certain time during an attack. In the original GameCube version of the game, the only ways to learn the correct timing for Stylish moves are to use the Timing Tutor badge sold by Charlieton or talk to Eddy the Mask in the town located in Rogueport Underground. In the remake, it is also possible to learn the timing for Stylish moves by talking to the Battle Master and practicing the appropriate move.
In the demo disc for Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, when Mario or any of his partners make a stylish move, 'STYLE' is shown instead of 'STYLISH!'

In Super Paper Mario, stylish moves are completely different. All characters have the same stylish moves. The player can chain stylish moves in this game, going from "Nice" to "Good" to "Great" to "Wonderful" to "Excellent". There are various ways to do stylish moves. They all begin by jumping on an enemy. Note that because Mario has no SP in this game, stylish moves simply serve to give the player more points, and thus level up a little faster.
