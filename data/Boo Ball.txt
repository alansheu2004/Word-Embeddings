Boo Balls are white spheres with the face of a Boo printed on each. They make their first and main appearance in Luigi's Mansion and its Nintendo 3DS version. While exploring the mansion, Luigi may follow the Boo Radar's signal to a Boo, only to find one of these decoys instead. They cannot harm Luigi, and he can suck them up onto the nozzle of his Poltergust 3000 and blow them out, destroying them.
Only one Boo Ball appears in Luigi's Mansion 3, in the Sandy Grand Hall in the Tomb Suites on the tenth floor. Unlike its previous appearance, the Boo Ball cannot be destroyed by sucking it in and then blowing it out. Instead, the player has to fire it at the top of the pyramid in order to destroy it. When the Boo Ball is destroyed, it releases three gold bats and the player earns an achievement called "Found and popped the beach ball in Tomb Suites."
