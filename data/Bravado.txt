Bravados are Rabbid enemies in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, only found in the Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC. Bravados first appear in the Boastin' Bravados battle. They are variants of Scopers that attack at long range. Bravados attack heroes by firing a single projectile that causes the Gust Super Effect. When attacked by a weapon, they will immediately counterattack. This ability is passive, and will occur on every weapon attack without cooldown. Bravados can climb up to higher ground as well. They are weak to Frostbite and resist Gust. One notable Bravado, known as "Iron Hands" Sydney Rabbidwhacker, is the bandit leader of the show for the Western Set, The Ballad of Plungerhands McMurdy.
Bravados are dusty brown in color and wear brown cowboy hats. They wear a dark red plaid eyepatch and a handkerchief of the same color around their necks. In real life, the word "bravado" means a bold manner or a show of boldness intended to impress or intimidate.

Where's JEANIE now, I wonder? Probably making all kinds of unauthorized changes to the WM ARC. I shall therefore have to do my best with the enemy analysis. The Bravados are detestable little long-range fighters that are always on the move, climbing to elevated positions from which to fire upon us from medium-range, where we remain under constant threat of their counter attacks and Gust Super Effects.
