The Spectral Catch is the nautical-themed twelfth floor of The Last Resort in Luigi's Mansion 3. It is accessible after obtaining this floor's elevator button from Nikki, Lindsey, & Ginny in the Twisted Suites, though the Elevator Hall is the only room that can be explored upon first arriving here. The door to the Grotto Lounge is blocked by the remains of a boat. After Luigi looks inside, Professor E. Gadd calls and tells him to return to the lab. There, Luigi learns that one of the Toads has gone missing at the Boilerworks while attempting to retrieve one of E. Gadd's inventions, forcing Luigi to return there and rescue the Toad. After that, E. Gadd gives Luigi the ability to use Super Suction so he can destroy the boat remains and access the rest of the floor.
At the Beach, there is a ship off in the distance. Ringing the bell on the pier summons it to shore, where the plank is laid out for Luigi. When he boards the ship, he find the yellow Toad's painting on the stern, but gets attacked by Captain Fishook, who reveals the Fitness Center's elevator button beneath his eye patch. He possesses the deck of the ship and tries to eat Luigi while Oozers throw powder kegs at him. Luigi has to drop the kegs in the wooden mouth to make Fishook vulnerable to attack. During his final phase, Fishook possesses the stern and tries to eat Luigi by tilting the ship upward. After sending more powder kegs into his mouth and vacuuming him once more, Luigi is able to capture Fishook, obtain the elevator button that grants access to the Fitness Center, and rescue the Toad.
Later, Luigi returns here while chasing Polterkitty, who stole the elevator button found in the Fitness Center. However, Polterkitty escapes yet again to the Twisted Suites.
