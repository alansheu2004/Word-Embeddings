A Lakipea is the Beanbean Kingdom counterpart to Lakitu that appears in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga and the Nintendo 3DS remake, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions. Their name is a portmanteau of "Lakitu" and "pea". Lakipeas are nearly identical to regular Lakitus, with the only differences being that the Lakipea has a sprout growing on its head and a vine-covered cloud. In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions they have been redesigned to have more visible bodies, less opaque goggles, and two leaves on their heads instead of one, while their clouds have been given faces, much like regular Lakitus.
They are found in the east side of Beanbean Fields, and can throw up to three Sharpea eggs at Mario and Luigi in the overworld. The eggs will hatch into Sharpeas that act as separate encounters, and both the eggs and Sharpeas can catch the brothers off guard. To engage in combat with the Lakipea itself, the Bros. will have to seek higher ground or else try a High Jump to reach them.
Lakipeas also appear as enemies in the Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser mode. They are flying troopers and attack the same as Lakitus. They are strong against Spinies and weak against Shy Guys.

Lakipeas will only attack by throwing Sharpea eggs at the Mario Bros., who can counter the attack with their hammers. If there are open spaces on the battlefield, the egg will hatch into a Sharpea that tries to ram into the target brother, and countering will damage it. However, if two Sharpeas are already present when the egg attack is used, it will simply bounce towards its target without hatching. In the original game, hammering any extra eggs knock them off-screen; in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, the eggs instead fly back towards the Lakipea and damage them.
