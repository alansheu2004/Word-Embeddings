The Rock Paper Wizards are characters in Paper Mario: Color Splash that compete in the Roshambo Temple. A Rock Paper Wizard is the last opponent Mario faces during Super Roshambo after defeating a Koopaling, or Kamek, during the main story. Defeating the Rock Paper Wizard earns Mario a Koopaling or Kamek Battle Card, along with 1000 coins. After being defeated in the eighth Roshambo Temple, the Rock Paper Wizard takes off his paper hat and he turns out to be a Toad. When Mario leaves the temple, it turns out there were eight Rock Paper Wizards in total, all waiting outside.
After all the Rock Paper Wizards are defeated, checking the Prisma Caf√© at each temple shows their masks behind the owners. They also comment about the Rock Paper Wizards when talked to. The Rock Paper Wizards send Mario a letter after all of them are defeated.
Concept art of the Rock Paper Wizard (shown below) depicts him in an outfit that gives him a somewhat similar appearance to a Duplighost, an enemy that appeared in Paper Mario and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, as well as one that looks like a Lantern Ghost. The name of this character is a pun on the real world hand game called rock paper scissors.
