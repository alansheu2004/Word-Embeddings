Badge Challenge Floating High Jump I is a Badge Challenge course in Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It is found in Fluff-Puff Peaks and is unlocked after clearing Condarts Away! This course is designed around the abilities of the Floating High Jump Badge. Completion of this course does not unlock any new courses. The difficulty of this course is one star, and it houses one Wonder Seed.

The players start at an area where they must traverse past pipes where Piranha Plants dwell. After making some progress there is a Long ? Block that has Super Mushrooms. After jumping across a gap, the players will come across the first Checkpoint Flag. The path now leads upwards, where the players must climb up pipes to reach to higher ground. The second Checkpoint Flag is found right after a Big Piranha Plant. Beyond the second Checkpoint Flag are big pipes that act as platforms with some solid ground and gaps in between. There is also another Big Piranha Plants that must be jumped over. At the end of the past lies the Goal Pole, with two Big Piranha Plants before it. If the players want to reach the top of the Goal Pole, they must jump over the Big Piranha Plants.
