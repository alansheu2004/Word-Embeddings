The Rainy Balloons is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. Introduced in the 2019 Halloween Tour, it is the signature gliders of King Boo (Luigi's Mansion), Hammer Bro, Boomerang Bro, and Penguin Toad. The glider is a variant of the Cloud Glider with a darker color scheme resembling Lakithunder's cloud. Like the Cloud Glider, striking other drivers with Lightning grants more points than usual upon using this glider.

As of the Battle Tour, the Rainy Balloons is obtainable from regular tour pipes, including the All-Clear Pipe. It is also a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the glider's special availability by tour.
