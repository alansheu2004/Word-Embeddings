Trampoline Time is one of Mario's minigames in Super Mario 64 DS and a Variety minigame in New Super Mario Bros. In this minigame, the player has to draw trampolines so that the Mario clones can jump on them and bounce to open windows.

The minigame starts with a giant trampoline that will disappear after three Marios land on it. A player can draw more trampolines with the stylus; however, they disappear with only one Mario landing on them. There is a limit of three trampolines onscreen at a time, with the exception of the giant trampoline. If a Mario lands on the center of a trampoline, he bounces higher than normal. Also, if a Mario hits a wall at the right angle, he jumps off it for even more vertical distance.
For each Mario that the player guides to safety, they receive a point. The open window that the player must try to bounce the Marios towards changes periodically between the higher and lower windows. For every ten Marios that the player guides to safety, the structure increases in height (making the minigame more challenging), with the structure reaching its maximum height when 60 Marios have been guided to safety. Also, Marios appear at a faster rate as the minigame progresses. If three Mario clones fall off the screen, the minigame ends.
Trampoline Time bears some resemblance to Big Ape City from Donkey Kong Land. Also, the music for this minigame is "Secret Course" from Super Mario Sunshine.
The icons are different between Super Mario 64 DS and New Super Mario Bros.; the former's icon shows Mario facing the screen while jumping, but the latter's one has Mario seeing the trampoline.
