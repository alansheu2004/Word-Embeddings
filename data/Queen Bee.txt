The Queen Bee is a High-End kart in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the 2019 Halloween Tour and became the signature kart of Monty Mole in the Flower Tour. The kart is a black and gold variant of the Bumble V with a cream stinger, wing rims, and windshield rims and a blue seat. Unlike the Bumble V, it uses the Sponge tires from Mario Kart 8 and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Like the Bumble V, this kart increases the duration of Dash Panel speed boosts and the number of points earned for using Dash Panels.

Starting in the Battle Tour, Queen Bee appears in pipes and has become a part of the Daily Selects lineup. The following table shows the kart's special availability by tour.
