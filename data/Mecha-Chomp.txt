Mecha-Chomps are Chain Chomp-like enemies that only appear in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. They are found at Woohoo Hooniversity, where they only appear during battles with Laser Snifits in the basement without appearing on the field. Mecha-Chomps have a grey canine-like body, a retractable neck, a large LED display presumably used as an eye, and wheels for moving around. They appear to be based on real-life toy robotic dogs, such as Tekno the Robotic Puppy.
In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, Mecha-Chomps are replaced by Mechakoopas, who were previously used as conductors in Bowser's Castle.

Mecha-Chomps attack by moving towards the Bros. on their wheels, then stopping as the LED on their head cycles between red and green, eventually stopping on one of the two as the Mecha-Chomps throw their head at the appropriate target: Mario if it is red, Luigi if it is green. Sometimes, if a Mecha-Chomp is damaged, it starts to malfunction, meaning that the colors it displays will be for the opposite targets (red for Luigi, green for Mario); using Thunderhand will always cause it to malfunction. Additionally, the item it drops while malfunctioning changes from a Nut to the School Emblem Badge; this makes the badge missable if Mario or Luigi's attack power gets high enough.
