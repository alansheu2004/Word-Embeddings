Piranha Pods are a Piranha Plant version of Spiny Eggs. Like Spiny Eggs, they are thrown by Lakitus, but turn into a Piranha Plant upon landing, rather than a Spiny.

Piranha Pods make their debut appearance in New Super Mario Bros. U in the levels Blooming Lakitus, and in New Super Luigi U in the levels Spinning Sandstones and Beanstalk Jungle. Here, Piranha Pods are thrown by the Lakitus that occasionally show up in these levels where, after bouncing off the ground slightly, become a Piranha Plant that remains stationary on the ground. Piranha Pods can be defeated in the same ways a Spiny Egg can be defeated, including shooting a fireball at them with Fire Mario or touching them while invincible.

In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Viridi briefly mentions Piranha Pods during Palutena's Guidance dialogue for Piranha Plant.

Piranha Pods reappear on the Peach's Birthday Cake board in Mario Party Superstars, replacing the Strawberry Seeds from the original Mario Party, though they are still referred to as strawberries. In-game, the term is used liberally to refer to both the pod itself and the Piranha Plant that grows out of it, while a Play Nintendo article reserves "strawberry" for the Piranha Pods. In the board, Piranha Pods can be bought from a Lakitu if a player lands on certain Event Spaces. They come in two sizes, small (costing 5 coins) and large (costing 30 coins). Small Piranha Pods grow into regular Piranha Plants, while large Piranha Pods grow into Big Piranha Plants.
