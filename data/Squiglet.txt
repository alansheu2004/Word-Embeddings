Squiglets are enemies in Super Paper Mario. They have at least four black legs and attack by walking into the player. Squiglets are similar to Goombas in the game, as they simply walk back and forth, and can only damage the heroes if they come into contact with one of its sides. However, a difference between the two is that when a Squiglet spots a hero, a Squiglet will hop up and down. Like red-shelled Koopa Troopas, they do not walk off ledges. Squiglets are the most common enemies in the game, more common than Goombas. They often appear in pairs and show up alongside Squigs, a stronger variant of Squiglets. They appear in the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials in rooms 1, 3, 8, 27, 41, and 97.
Their name comes from either "square" or "squiggle", and "piglet".
