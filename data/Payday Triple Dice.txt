The Payday Triple Dice is an item in Super Mario Party Jamboree. It looks like a Triple Dice but is completely plated in solid gold. It initially acts like a Triple Dice with the player rolling three Dice Blocks. However, when the total roll is revealed, the player will then receive coins equal to the amount rolled. The player can potentially get 3-30 free coins with the Payday Triple Dice, along with an additional 20 coin bonus for matching numbers or 50 coin bonus for matching sevens similar to the Triple Dice.
Mario's Jamboree Buddy ability dice roll also adds to the total amount of coins for a maximum of 79 coins (with a roll of matching sevens for 21 coins, the 50 coin bonus, and an 8 from Mario).
