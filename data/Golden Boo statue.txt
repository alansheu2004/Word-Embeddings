The golden Boo statue is a key item in Mario Party Advance. It is a symbol of the friendship that the three Boos at the Boo Cemetery share. They try to keep it a secret from outsiders. At some point, Koopa Kid stole the statue and disguises himself as one of the Boos and stays with them.
When the player arrives at the cemetery, the Boos ask them, and later Shroomlock, to find the statue for them. Shroomlock notices since a fourth Boo is with them, the odd one out must be the thief. Once the player correctly identifies Koopa Kid, he loses his disguise and runs away, leaving the Boo Statue behind. As thanks, the Boos give them the Predictotron Gaddget.
