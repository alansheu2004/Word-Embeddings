Hammer Island is one of 11 accessible islands in the Great Sea in Paper Mario: The Origami King. It is found in the west part of the sea, charted in territory A-4 on the Sea Chart with a hammer icon. Notably, the Legendary Hammer, the strongest hammer in the game, is found here. While there are no Not-Bottomless Holes to repair on this island, there are four hidden ? Blocks to be revealed and struck, two Collectible Treasures to be found, and only one Toad to be rescued.

Upon arriving at the island, Captain T. Ode notes its shape and names it accordingly. At the time Mario and Olivia get off the boat and onto the dock, it appears the island is peaceful, with not much more than a treasure chest in the middle and a stone Toad statue in back. There is a slab beneath the statue that reads "Seek ye a path to paradise". The treasure chest contains the Legendary Hammer, described as the strongest hammer in the game. When Mario opens the chest, six Fire Bros appear from shrubs on the ledges and throw fireballs to set Mario's path aflame. Mario must get onto the adjacent ledges and defeat the Fire Bros to clear the path. After the flames dissipate, there are three small holes on the ground that Mario can hammer to reveal their contents. One contains a good number of 10-Coins, one contains a Flashy Mushroom, and the other contains a Toad rolled up in a scroll that Mario must pull out of the hole to reveal the Toad. As thanks for rescuing him, the Toad marks a spot on the Sea Chart where a treasure is to be found.
