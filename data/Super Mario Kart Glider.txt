The Super Mario Kart Glider is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It first appeared in the Super Mario Kart Tour, and as evidenced by the name, it is a glider that has artwork from Super Mario Kart emblazoned on top. The glider is fairly similar to the Parafoil, but with more of a square shape rather than the Parafoil's rectangular shape. The Super Mario Kart Glider improves the chances of getting Mushrooms from Item Boxes and increases the number of points awarded for using Mushrooms.

The Super Mario Kart Glider is not currently obtainable from regular pipes, and it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows its availability by tour.
