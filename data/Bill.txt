Bills (known as Notes in British and Australian English) are a type of money that adds to the player's "G" (gold) counter in the Luigi's Mansion series. Luigi can vacuum them up and collect them by using the various Poltergust models seen throughout the games. In Luigi's Mansion, bills are worth 20,000G, being the third-lowest form of money, after coins and Red Diamonds. They come in green and brown colors, but this is only for aesthetics. In Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, bills are also a form of currency, now valued at 5G and sporting an entirely green color. In the Nintendo 3DS remake of Luigi's Mansion, bills have the same role as in the original Nintendo GameCube game. In Luigi's Mansion 3, bills are based on their role from Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. However, bills can be released from a money bag by vacuuming at it with the Poltergust G-00, and destroying a piggy bank releases a few bills and several coins.
