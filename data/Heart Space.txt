Heart Spaces are spaces that appear in the Bowser Party mode of Mario Party 10. They are colored pink with a purple heart on the middle, and "+" symbol and a number on the bottom.
When a member of Team Mario lands on one of these spaces, all of the members in the team get the amount of hearts that are written on the space. If players are out because they lost all of their hearts, they come back to the game after a member of their team lands on the space. When players are revived, they come back to the board in a bubble.
