The Gold Penguin Wingtip is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour which debuted in the Penguin Tour. As the name indicates, the glider is a gold-colored variant of the Penguin Wingtip. Unlike the Penguin Wingtip, this glider improves the chances of obtaining Coins from Item Boxes and increases the number of points earned for using Coins from the inventory.

The Gold Penguin Wingtip is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. However, it has been included in the Daily Spotlight lineup for every tour since the Battle Tour. The following table shows its special availability by tour.
