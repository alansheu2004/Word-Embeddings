Wario's Mustache is a High-End glider in Mario Kart Tour. It was introduced in the Wario vs. Waluigi Tour. As the name suggests, the glider is a balloon in the shape of Wario's nose and mustache. Hitting racers with Lightning grants more points when using this glider. A similar glider in the shape of Waluigi's nose and mustache, named Waluigi's Mustache, debuts alongside Wario's Mustache in the Wario vs. Waluigi Tour. Two similar gliders in the shape of Mario and Luigi's nose and mustache debuted in the 2022 Mii Tour, and are known as Mario's Mustache and Luigi's Mustache.
