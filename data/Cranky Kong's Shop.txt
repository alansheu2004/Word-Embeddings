Cranky Kong's Shop is a shop run by Cranky Kong in Donkey Kong Country Returns and its Nintendo 3DS remake, Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D. It serves as the successor to Cranky's Cabin from Donkey Kong Country, which according to Cranky himself, is due to his pension having been revoked.
There is a shop in each of the eight worlds, although they all carry the same selection of goods at the same prices. Many useful items can be purchased at these shops in exchange for Banana Coins. Although most of what Cranky sells is not mandatory, he does sell a key in each world, which will open up an alternate path on the map, allowing the player(s) to access additional levels. This is required for completing the game by 100 percent.
As with previous games, Cranky will sometimes complain about his situation such as needing Banana Coins, being stuck in a shack, or how the game is "too hard" for Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. He often makes snide remarks about the items purchased by the player(s), and frequently alludes to the Golden Temple. If the player(s) currently have a maximum number of 99 lives, Cranky refuses to sell a Red Balloon to them. Likewise, if the player(s) buy a key, they cannot purchase it again.
The shop was replaced by Funky's Fly 'n' Buy in Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, due to Cranky Kong becoming a playable character.
