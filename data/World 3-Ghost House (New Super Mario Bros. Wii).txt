World 3-Ghost House is the first Ghost House level in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. It is unlocked by completing World 3-2, marks the first appearances of Boos and Big Boos. It also introduces a new enemy, the Ghost Vase. Completing this level is not required to advance in the game, but doing so through the normal goal unlocks a Red Toad House, while finding the hidden goal unlocks a Warp Cannon leading to World 6.

When the level starts, a door can be seen; however, if the players attempt to enter, Boos laugh and the door disappears, leaving a coin behind. Behind the starting point is a wall with a hidden area with the first Star Coin inside. The players should go up the staircase while some Ghost Vases and confronting two Boos. At the end of the path is another fake door, but there is a hidden area in the wall containing the actual door leading to the next room. Once there, the players must climb up poles while avoiding Boos. At the end of this area is another Star Coin hidden below the door. The next chamber is similar to the first one, except that the hidden area behind the wall contains a Coin Block instead of a Star Coin, and a rope is extended on the ceiling. Mario should grab it and then fall onto one of the moving platforms leading to the exit. Outside, the players must avoid a Boo guarding the end pole.

Upon seeing the first yellow moving platform in the third room where the players are climbing across ropes on the ceiling (pictured), they should stop and wait until it moves away. The players should then fall, landing on a hidden platform with a door. When they enter they find themselves on a platform slowly descending, with many Boos floating around. On the right side, about halfway down the shaft, is a ? Block containing a Super Star. The third Star Coin is also hidden nearby. A door at the bottom of the shaft leads outside, where a Boo guards the hidden goal. This exit unlocks World 3-Cannon, a Warp Cannon which takes the players directly to World 6.
