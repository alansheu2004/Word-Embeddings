Master Toad is a minor character in Paper Mario: The Origami King. He is a yellow Toad serving as the proprietor of the luxurious mansion found in Toad Town. He is one of various Toads throughout the game in need of rescue.

If Mario enters the luxurious mansion early in the game, he finds the residence empty, aside from a Folded Soldier Goomba hidden in one of the cabinets. Although there is a treasure chest on the other side of the second floor of the mansion, it is across a large gap and cannot be reached via the interior.
While exploring Shroom City/Snif City in Scorching Sandpaper Desert, Mario may notice a Toad folded into a square, displayed on the large entrance sign along with various items. Nearby, there is a Snifit on a seesaw. Mario must head behind the two-room inn next to the seesaw and hop up the crates to find himself atop the structure. By slightly aligning himself off the edge, Mario must then hop onto the raised end of the seesaw to launch the Snifit into the back of the entrance sign, knocking off the Toad along with several items, including a Shiny Mushroom, Shiny Fire Flower, Flashy Hammer, and Ice Flower. By hammering the rescued Toad, Mario may reveal him to be the owner of the estate in Toad Town. He claims to have been trapped for some time before departing for his residence back in town, suggesting Mario stop by later on to be rewarded.
From this point onward, Master Toad may be found resting on the second floor of his mansion, with his steward having returned as well. According to the steward, he has returned from his travels with even more wealth. If Mario speaks to Master Toad, he once again thanks him for rescuing him earlier and places ten bags of gold nearby, each worth one thousand coins. Mario may collect them immediately or gradually, though they otherwise remain here for the duration of the game. In addition to this, the master unlocks all doors in his mansion, allowing for easier navigation of the estate.
