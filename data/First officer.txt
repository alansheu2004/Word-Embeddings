A first officer is a special type of minion position introduced in Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey. In Bowser Jr.'s Journey, certain minions can optionally be made a "first officer", which function somewhat differently than normal minions in combat, as they stand beside Bowser Jr. rather than actively begin fighting right away. They only begin fighting once an enemy is within range of them (which is more easily seen with ranged minions), or if an enemy engages them directly, or Bowser Jr. Only the Koopalings and Kamek can be made first officers, the latter only after clearing Chilling Magma, with each character providing different combat bonuses once chosen.
First officers have commands in the same way that Bowser Jr. does, and can gain additional commands and command points as they level up. First officer commands are used with  and . Also like Bowser Jr., command points can be gained after every battle - by 1 if the first officer's maximum CP is 1-5, 2 if the first officer's maximum CP is 6-8, and 3 if the first officer's maximum CP is 9 or 10. In the screen where the player selects which minions they wish to battle with, the first officer slot is above Bowser Jr.
