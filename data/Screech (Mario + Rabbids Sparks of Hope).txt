Screech is a Spark that appears in Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope. Screech is found in the Beacon Beach Secret Zone. After the Heroes arrive here, Screech joins them on their adventure.
Screech's ability is Whoopsgottago, which repels all enemies within range away from the Hero's position, similar to Rabbid Yoshi's technique Scaredy Rabbid from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Screech can be upgraded by feeding it Star Bits. When upgraded, the range of Screech's ability will increase. Its passive ability is Critical Buddy, which increases the critical hit chance of weapon attacks.
Screech is a white Spark that wields a megaphone. Its loud sound drives the enemies away from it.
