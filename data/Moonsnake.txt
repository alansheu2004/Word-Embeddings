Moonsnakes are a primitive Streptococcus-like species that appear as obstacles in Super Mario Odyssey. They have a similar appearance and behavior to the Spike Bar obstacles seen in other games; however, they appear to be made out of segments of rolling rock instead of metal and have a base made out of Moon Rock. They come in different lengths, and some have more than one set on a base. Some Moonsnakes are also able to move back and forth in a set path. They appear in the Seaside Kingdom, in the Snow Kingdom, in the Moon Kingdom, in the Mushroom Kingdom, on the Dark Side, and on the Darker Side. They cannot be defeated by any means. The brochure for the Moon Kingdom refers to the ones found in the Moon Kingdom and Seaside Kingdom as separate but similar species, and speculates that lunar creatures such as them may be the evolutionary origin of all life on Earth.
