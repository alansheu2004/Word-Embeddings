The Piranha Plant Hanafuda is a glider that appears in Mario Kart Tour. It is a variant of the Baby Mario Hanafuda with a hanafuda-style drawing of a Piranha Plant and is classified as a tour-exclusive High-End glider. The glider can be unlocked in the 2020 Los Angeles Tour, where it appears in a Tour Gift for Gold Pass members. Unlike the Baby Mario Hanafuda, using Super Horns grants more points when using this glider. It is the third character, kart, or glider to not have any secondary favored courses upon its addition to the game, after the Wicked Wings and the Barrel Hanafuda. Like the Baby Mario Hanafuda, the Yoshi's Egg Hanafuda, the Peach Hanafuda, the Barrel Hanafuda, the Blooper Hanafuda, the Cape Mario Hanafuda, the Bullet Bill Hanafuda, and the Boo Hanafuda, the artwork on the glider is taken from Mario Hanafuda, and the glider itself was added in the month it was used for in the set, September.

The Piranha Plant Hanafuda is not currently obtainable from pipes, and it is not currently a part of the Daily Selects set. The following table shows its availability by tour.
