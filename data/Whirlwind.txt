Whirlwinds appear as objects in the Mario & Luigi series. They first appeared in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga. Whirlwinds make their debut in the Hoohoo Mountain area, and they have intermittently appeared in several other locations. If Mario and Luigi move into a whirlwind while doing a Spin Jump, they are sucked into it. While inside, they can be launched farther than they could normally go. In Joke's End, the steam the broth cauldrons release can be spin-jumped into to create whirlwinds, and if Luigi hammers Pump Mario to make him spit out a glob of water at the whirlwind, it can be used to douse the fires on the lit candles in a room to open a door to progress.
Whirlwinds also appear in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time, Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey, where they serve the same purpose, to launch the Mario Bros. farther than they could normally go when they spin-jump into them.
