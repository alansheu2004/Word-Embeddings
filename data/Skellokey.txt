Skellokeys (a portmanteau of "skeleton" and Pokey) are skeletal Pokeys found in Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. They are found in Toad Town and in the Star Shrine. Like other Pokeys in the game, Skellokeys start out with one head segment but gain more body segments when their turn comes. Skellokeys can only be battled by Baby Mario and Baby Luigi. 
In battle, a Skellokey has a few attacks. It can eat its own body segments and spit them at its enemies. It rolls toward the one it was meaning to attack before it attacks. However, if the Skellokey does a flip before spitting its segments, it spits them at the opposite baby brother. This attack can be blocked with the Hammer. However, if the body segments are not deflected, they rejoin with the Skellokey head. Skellokeys can also spit fireballs at enemies which can cause the Burn status ailment. This projectile attack can be jumped over. A Skellokey may also launch its body segments at an attacker. The individual body segment spins towards the Baby. it wants to attack. The body segments can be jumped over.
In Toad Town they have three segments, and in the Star Shrine they have four.
Unlike Pokeys, Skellokeys have spikes on top of their heads instead of flowers, meaning jumps are ineffective against them. Thus, each body segment must be eliminated if the head is to be attacked.
Toothy from Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story is similar to Skellokey, as both are bony variants of Pokeys.
