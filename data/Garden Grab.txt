Garden Grab is a 2-vs.-2 minigame in Mario Party 6. The changes between daytime and nighttime are only aesthetic.
This minigame appears in the Miracle Book on the page "Bountiful Harvest." Toad and Luigi are on the Red Team, and Peach and Koopa Kid are on the Blue Team. Activating the page pulls the carrots out and shows a Monty Mole on Toad and Luigi's side and Waluigi on Peach and Koopa Kid's. There is a bite taken out of the latter team's carrot.

Each team is grabbing on to the stems of a giant carrot. Both teams then slightly pull the carrots out of the ground.

Each team has to work together to pull up a giant carrot from the dirt. In the Japanese version, the giant carrots are giant daikon instead. To pull the carrot out, both players on the team must press the button shown one after another, then rapidly press the button shown until the carrot is uprooted. The team that pulls its carrot out of the ground first wins.

The winners' carrot flies out of the ground into their basket as they fall backward in shock. They then perform their winning animations in front of the basket. If the minigame ends in a tie, the players perform their losing animations and leave empty baskets.
