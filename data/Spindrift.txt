Spindrifts, or Flower Heads, are enemies in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS. They have spinning flowers on their heads that allow them to hover around.

Spindrifts roam around a small area, heading slowly towards the player character when he is in their proximity. They can hover above water in the Nintendo DS version. If the player character jumps on a Spindrift, it releases three coins and the character spin-jumps in the air, which can potentially allow him to reach certain higher areas. Spindrifts appear in both snow courses: Cool, Cool Mountain and Snowman's Land. In the latter course, several of them make their home inside an igloo, with the Japanese and Korean names for the mission Into the Igloo translating to "Spindrift's Home."

While standard Spindrifts do not appear in Super Mario Odyssey, one of the game's bosses, Torkdrift, is a mechanical Spindrift.

Spindrifts were included in pre-release builds in New Super Mario Bros. but were removed in the final version, where Spin Blocks fulfill their function.
