World 9-8 is the eighth and last level of World 9 in New Super Mario Bros. Wii, and consequently the final level of the game. It is unlocked by collecting every Star Coin in World 8. Like all levels in World 9, there is no midway point. The most prominent features of the stage are the bouncing clouds and the King Bills, the latter of which only appear in this stage. This level is also an autoscroller.

This is a sky level reminiscent of Coin Heaven. In this level, the "floor" is made of several Bouncy Clouds that let Mario jump every time he falls on them. A little ahead, two ? Blocks are found, one of which contains a Propeller Mushroom. A little more forward, the first Star Coin is found surrounded by Fuzzies and after this part, a Roulette Block is found surrounded by five Fuzzies, one being big. Below them, a ? Block from the right contains a Mini Mushroom that can help the player to access high places. After that, the second Star Coin is found alongside several Fuzzies.
Forward, King Bills begin to destroy walls so Mario and co. can continue their progress. The level forewarns the player of the King Bills with large Bullet Bill-shaped coin formations. The third Star Coin is found stuck between walls that a King Bill destroys. Arriving at the end of stage, a last King Bill appears near the pole, where it can be destroyed if Mario and co. jump on the pole before touching it. A P Switch found in a nearby brick indicates this last King Bill with a Blue Coin arrangement instead. Mario and co. are immune to getting hurt from the King Bill upon touching the top of the pole if all players are not at the pole before time runs out. This course has the background from World 7.
